            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>What warrant you have from the words of Chriſt for your baptiſing of Infants before they do actually believe.</hi>

                        <item>3. <hi>Whether the baptiſing of Beleevers, is not the Command of Chriſt, practiſed by the Apoſtles, yea or no, and left upon Record for us to follow and Imitate till his ſecond comming.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will begin with this your Laſt Quaere. For I perceive, that the baptiſing of Beleevers, doth keep ſuch a buzzing in your ears, that till it be granted you, nothing will be heard: Sir, for quietneſſe and brevity ſake I grant it, and this is all my anſwer to this your Quaere. Yea I granted as much to you, in the beginning, if you remember: and ſo thus alſo briefly, and quietly I have anſwered almoſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168478:2"/>a ſide of your ſecond ſheet, wherein are four Conſiderations brought, to prove the lawfulneſſe, the uſefulneſſe, the neceſſity of this practiſe, of Baptiſing Beleevers, with theſe ſolemn words, at the end of every conſideration, four times repeated, <hi>Judge ye, and Judge Righteous Judgement, for God will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>
                        <hi>Section I.</hi> Of Baptiſme of Infants.</head>
                     <p>I hope you will think me to judge Righteous Judgement, if I Judge according to your Judgement, That the Word of God doth allow and authorize, baptiſing of Beleevers; but then I muſt differ from your judgement in another, That the Baptiſing of Beleevers doth not diſallow, or exauthorate, the Baptiſing the Infants of Beleevers, and that the one leadeth in the other, as it were by the Hand; if you had no more to ſay and diſpute againſt the Baptiſing of Infants of beleeving Parents, than againſt the baptiſing of beleevers, the difference betwixt us had never begun.</p>
                     <p>If I ſpeak Parables unto you, it is becauſe you know not the Scriptures, not the very Scriptures your ſelf doth here quote, <hi>Matth,</hi> 28.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 238. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. <hi>Acts</hi> 10 47. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What do they all import, but that, Thoſe Jewes or Heathens, who were grown perſons, aliens from the Covenant, had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Goſpel and became beleevers, were preſently baptiſed, or became baptiſeable: And now that this is no barr, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Baptiſing of Infants, appears, for that the Infants of thoſe beleevers baptiſed and entred into Covenant, if they had any, had likewiſe a right unto baptiſme, being in the ſame Covenant with their beleeving Parents, and either were in preſent baptiſed, or were of right baptiſeable: So that the baptiſme of beleevers, makes way and gives ground for the baptiſme of their Infants, whence in other texts, ſuch and ſuch beleevers were baptiſed, they and all their Houſe; which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenor of the Cov nane, in which God is, the God of the beleever and his ſeed, ſo that the one hath as good right to the Seal thereof as the other by vertue of the Covenant, God having Covenanted with both together.</p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:168478:2"/>
                     <p>I have formerly ſuggeſted unto you the only word, that muſt help you here, to make the baptiſme of beleevers ſtrong againſt the baptiſme of Infants; and it is, the Word only; for if there were ſuch a precept or practice to be found in Scripture, of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing Beleevers only, then you would write ſomething near the matter (but yet ſhould not ſo carry it away, to the overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the baptiſing of the Infants of beleevers, the Scripture no where calling them unbeleevers): But none of the Scriptures you cite, none of your conſiderations you mention, do ſo much as mention, much leſſe infer the baptiſing of Beleevers onely; Therefore now, Judge you, but Judge Righteous Judgement, even as Good doth, you ſee, in your own Texts.</p>
                     <p>Or do you mean another matter, as I gheſſe it, That Infants of beleevers born within the Church and Covenant, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in their minority, when afterwards they attain to ſome ripeneſſe of knowledge and profeſſion of faith of Chriſt, ſhould then, as beleevers themſelves, be baptiſed again, Then I muſt tell you, that which you call the firſt and great Ordinance of the New Teſtament, is neither great, nor firſt, nor Ordinance, namely ſuch Baptiſing of Beleevers; Nay then I muſt tell you, ſuch baptiſing of beleevers, is not only to be neglected and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but ſlighted and rejected, yea preached againſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, as now in preſent it ſhal be. For what is this your baptiſing of beleevers, but a rebaptiſing of them who were baptiſed before rightly, and (for any thing you know) beleevers alſo?</p>
                     <p>For firſt, God having given the Infants of beleeving Parents, Right unto the Sacrament of Baptiſme, by ſpeciall priviledge of their Birth within the boſome of the holy Church, and the Miniſter having adminiſtred the Sacrament of Baptiſme unto ſuch in the true Element of Water, with the Evangelical words, <hi>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> according to Chriſts inſtitution, Containing in them the matter &amp; form, and ſo the very eſſence of outward baptiſm, ſuch baptiſm is good, ſufficient, effectual and avayleable to Gods Children, and they ought not to be rebaptiſed: eſpecially there being the devout invocation made to God for his bleſſing, alſo a ſerious application of both, the Element, and Word unto the party who receiveth both, and that ſecret reference which this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168478:3"/>hath to life and remiſion of ſins by vertue of Chriſts own compact made ſolemnly with his Church, there is not any thing more required to the myſticall perfection of baptiſme outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within the Church of God, conſtituted and planted.</p>
                     <p>Now that ſuch Baptiſme is not to be reiterated, that Infants thus baptiſed, are not to be rebaptiſed, I ſhall prove unto you, both by the Word of God, and ſome reaſons thence deduced: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. <hi>There is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme,</hi> one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, not onely, 1. Becauſe it hath every where one and the ſame ſubſtance, conſiſting in one and the ſame matter; one and the ſame form; for we are not to uſe any other Elemental mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but Water, if it may be had, nor any other verbal form but this, <hi>I baptiſe thee in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> not onely, 2. Becauſe it offreth unto all men one and the ſame grace, even one ſaith of one Lord into w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we are baptiſed, but <hi>One</hi> alſo, for that it ought not to be received of any one man above once, even as we ſerve that Lord, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is but one, becauſe no other can be joyned with him, &amp; imbrace that faithwhich is but one, becauſe it admiteth no inovation; ſo we receive haptiſm w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is but one, becauſe it cannot, and muſt not be received often. Thus all the Pious, &amp; Learned, and Primitive Profeſſors have interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Text, and conceived of this matter, the Iteration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme once given, to be a manifeſt contempt and violation of this Apoſtolical axiom and Aphoriſme, inſomuch, that though the baptiſing miniſter were a Sciſmatick or Heretick, or a wicked one, they held their baptiſme good and valid, and would not repeat it being performed in the true Eſſentials, the form of Words, and matter of Water (as before) yea and when ſuch were converted and returned into the Church, they did note re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſe them, but received them and held them in that baptiſme which they had in their Schiſm and Hereſie, knowing the ſame to have been according to the form preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>I have no reaſon I confeſſe, to put a weapon of an objection into your hands, out of 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. but if I do, it is to take it out of your hands again, both to give you a blow in preſent, and prevent an after-blow. It is indeed there thus ſaid, <hi>When they heard this, they were baptiſed in the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> and its ſaid before Verſe 3. that they <hi>were baptiſed unto</hi> Johns <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> This Text hath been much and mightily urged, and preſſed,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168478:3"/>even to the Vexation of the Spirit, by your torturing Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and truly the words lye doubtfully and ambiguouſly at the firſt hearing, as if <hi>Paul</hi> baptiſed the Diſciples of <hi>Epheſus</hi> with the Baptiſme of Chriſt, who had before received the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> and were never full and well cleered and explicated, until <hi>Beza</hi> took them in hand, who ingeniouſly confeſſeth that he received the ſame interpretation, from that Noble, Pious, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and Induſtrious Divine <hi>Philippus Marnixius,</hi> that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ornament of the Belgick Church; who was born in 1538. and dyed in 1598. and lies in body buried at <hi>Leyden.</hi> I ſay this, becauſe his name ought to be precious in the Churches even for this interpretation, (though he wrote Commentaries upon divers other books of the Bible:) and ſo ought the name of <hi>Theodorus Beza,</hi> to be venerable with us, as that ſingular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the Gallick Church, for the like Piety, Induſtey, Learning, and Vertue, as by whoſe means this interpretation, came to our hands of this Church.</p>
                     <p>I remember I have read it or heard it, written and ſpoken, and I may (I think) write it &amp; ſpeak it again, that as when God found <hi>David,</hi> he ſound a Man after his own heart: So when <hi>David</hi> found <hi>Mollerus,</hi> he found an expounder, according to his heart, and I may apply it thus here alſo, That when Chriſt found <hi>Paul,</hi> he found a choſen veſſel and beloved Apoſtle, after Chriſt own heart, and when he found <hi>Luke,</hi> he found a choiſe Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher of the Acts of the Apoſtles, after his heart, and a beloved Phyſician, beſides; ſo when <hi>Luke</hi> found <hi>Beza,</hi> (and <hi>Beza Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nixius,</hi>) he found interpreters of them, after his own heart, and Beloved Divines moreover. But what need ſuch a Trumpet afore hand? The Almes given, the interpretations given by theſe wo thies, will deſerve it, and I do not blow this for your ſake, Sir, but others that may (perhaps) read it.</p>
                     <p>The ſum of the Interpretation is this, that in the 5th. Verſe above cited, <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks not of any Baptiſme done by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks on ſtill of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, and ſo you and all <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are blown away from this Text, as to any Anabaptiſme or Rebaptiſations hence to be had: This is a ſhort and ſweet interpretation, if it can be proved; Yes learned <hi>Beza</hi> proves it, and that from the two Greek Conjunctive Particles, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (I pray Sir, ſtand aloof, if you be afraid; but you ſhall not need, I do not Conjure; It is no Heathen Greek, no humane

So thirdly, they were the ſame in effect and efficacy. For <hi>John</hi> preached (and practiſed) the baptiſme of Repentance, for, or unto, the Remiſſion of Sins, <hi>Marke</hi> 1.4. the ſame which the Apoſtles did in and by their adminiſtration of baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>And Chriſt himſelf teſtifieth, that the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the fulfilling of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. and that the Publicans and People being baptiſed of <hi>John,</hi> Juſtified God; But the Phariſeet deſpiſing the Counſel of God, were not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. Whereby it appears, that <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme, was a part of that All Righteouſneſſe; a piece of the whole Counſel of God, which they that partaked of, Juſtified and declared God to be good and righteous.</p>
                     <p>Were it not ſo, the Apoſtles themſelves might be queſtioned, whether truly baptiſed, as who were no doubt baptiſed of <hi>John,</hi> ſome of them being firſt his Diſciples: for where elſe ſhould they be baptiſed, ſeeing Chriſt with his own hands baptiſed none, unleſſe one of them ſhould baptiſe another, which is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And Laſtly, If <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme were not one and the ſame with ours, that we have of Chriſts, how do we injoy the ſame common baptiſme with Chriſt, who was baptiſed of <hi>John?</hi> It will follow, That Chriſt was baptiſed with another baptiſm than we are, and ſo that our baptiſme was not ſanctified in the perſon and fleſh of Chriſt, (like as the Jews circumciſion was) and ſo it will abate much of our Comfort that we have Chriſtian Baptiſme, the members one and the ſame Baptiſme with our head.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have driven you off this ſhoar of <hi>Jordan John Baptiſts</hi> Wharf, where you ſee you cannot land or ground your dipping of Chriſtians, or your Rebaptiſing of Chriſtened people (as we ſpeak.) Though I muſt withall prompt you here, that our Quaere is in theſe tearms twixt <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and us. Whether
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168478:6"/>the baptiſm of Chriſt, (which is given to and received by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Cariſtians or Chriſtian infants) may be iterated, and you and they bring a Text to ſhew that the baptiſm of <hi>Iohn</hi> was iterated, which as it is not to the ſcope and purpoſe, ſo neither can you ſhew the ſame was iterated ever in the twelve Diſciples, or any other baptiſed of <hi>Iohn.</hi> I ſay, ſo long as you hold the baptiſm of <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſt, to be two different and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnant baptiſmes, you cannot inforce upon us from <hi>Iohns</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes iterated, (ſuppoſe ſo;) Chriſts baptiſm to be iterated: It will be beſt for you therefore (ſee how ſtill and ever I am ready to give the beſt counſell I can) to yeeld to the identity of both <hi>Iohns</hi> and Chriſts baptiſm as to the nature and ſubſtance of them, and ſo indeed you may argue from the one to the other. Hale in therefore again, your Fly-boat, to <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> ſhoar, and ſee if you can land there, any thing to your purpoſe, caſt on this right ſide your net again into <hi>Iordan,</hi> &amp; catch a frog: Whatſoever you get, you then and thus will loſe your new and true friends, the Papiſts and Jeſuites; for they row hard againſt you, and theſe throw their nets on the other ſide, holding that <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts baptiſm are very far aſunder and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the very Eſſentials; and do and will accurſe you with Tridentine Book, Bell, and Candle, and Lantern too of their ſhip, (none of which, I know, you can abide, eſpecially not the Book and Bell) and Anathematiſe all, who ſay that <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts baptiſm are the ſame for ſubſtance, and of the ſame force.</p>
                     <p>It is like to be a hot ſea-fight, (as moſt an end, the hotteſt fights are upon the water, and there is moſt fire ſpit out) or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a cold River skirmiſh twixt you; which, I for my part, do not intend to ſtand looking on, though I have ſet you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ears, but will thus leave you to fight it out to the laſt man; and will paſſe away, and on to another Text, preſſed and ſqueezed by ſome of your party for the Rebaptiſing of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed ones.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. Where there is mention made, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>The Doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes:</hi> Lo, ſay they, Here are Baptiſmes, in the plurall, as well as one Baptiſm in the ſingular, and if your reaſon were good, why the Apoſtle called it, one Baptiſm, becauſe it is to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168478:7"/>be but once given and received, may not we ſay (ſay they) our reaſon is good why the ſame Apoſtle calleth, Many Baptiſmes, two at leaſt: and ſo, baptiſe you your Infants in their Infancy, and we will baptiſe ours in their growth, when they can make profeſſion of Faith: And ſo here are baptiſmes. Truely this is ſomewhat like the diſcourſe the Saduces had with Chriſt, about one Woman, who had ſeaven Husbands, whoſe Wife ſhe ſhall be of the ſeaven in the Reſurrection. I ſay and anſwer in Generall as Chriſt did; Are yee not therefore deceived, and do err, becauſe you know not the Scripture? I could tell you here, of the baptiſmes, that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the other of Chriſt, to be here meant, and (you may remember, if you have done fighting with the Papiſts) that we are agreed about them two, to be but one and the ſame baptiſm: I could tell you, that the Apoſtle here writing to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> alluded to their old Legal Waſhings, Ablutions, and Baptiſmes, minding them of thens, but wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing them withall to lay them by, and mind the one Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical baptiſm, and the ſprinkling of Chriſts blood, the which they did but typifie or look at: So ſtill but one baptiſm. I could tell you, that the baptiſmes here meant, are thoſe (I muſt ſpeak three words more of Human Latine, for the words ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the elegancy of them) <hi>Fluminis, Flaminis, Songuinis:</hi> But I will turn them into divine Engliſh words for yoru ſake, of Water, Fire, Blood: For there, as I ſaid before, is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward baptiſm, which is the waſhing of the fleſh with Water by the Miniſter: and there is an inward baptiſm, which is waſhing of the Soul with the blood of Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt, theſe are baptiſmes indeed, and here meant, but in all Gods true Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they meet in one baptiſm, and they come from God, as one baptiſm, entirely made up of theſe two ſorts, the outward and inward: for that baptiſm, which is of blood, mentioned by Chriſt, and mentioned to his two Diſciples, <hi>(are ye able to be baptiſed with the baptiſm I am baptiſed with)</hi> and reſolved for them <hi>(ye ſhall indeed be baptiſed with ſuch baptiſm)</hi> Matth. 20.22. It is nothing but a conſtant ſuffering and conflicting in Chriſts cauſe, even unto Blood, and the ſuffering of Martyrdom for his ſake.</p>
                     <p>But I will call in again for <hi>Beza,</hi> whom as before I ſtiled an interpreter of <hi>Luke,</hi> and that Text <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5. according to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168478:7"/>his heart, (Though he confeſſed, he learned the interpretation of <hi>Marnixius,</hi>) ſo here alſo I may ſtile him an interpreter of <hi>Luke</hi> again, and of this Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. according to his heart, the which interpretation alſo he learned of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who ſaith to this purpoſe, an interpreter of thoſe Apoſtles and Prophets he commented upon, according to their hearts, (though here <hi>Beza</hi> doth not acknowlege ſo much) There was a right and Cuſtom in the Church Primitive of adminiſtring many bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes, upon certain ſet dayes; which ſet dayes were after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, to be <hi>Eaſterday</hi> and <hi>Whitſunday</hi> eſpecially, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Catehumens and New Converts were wont to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for baptiſm; Theſe therefore were called, Dayes of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes, as appears out of the writings of the Antient both Greeks and Latines, ſo ſtill it was but one, and the ſame baptiſm was conferred upon every one, though called baptiſmes, becauſe ſo many received baptiſm together upon one day, like as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in <hi>London,</hi> ſix ſeaven, and more Children partake of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm together at one time.</p>
                     <p>And now, Sirs, are you Maſters in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and know not theſe things? are you Dippers, and know not theſe Baptiſmes? and wheras for the time ye ought not to be Teachers, for that ye have need that one Teach you which be the firſt Principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, learn, that this doctrine of Baptiſmes, is the third of them the principles, and that it containeth nothing of two Baptiſmes, our baptiſing Chriſtians born in their infancy and your baptiſing Chriſtians born in their grown age, and leaſt of all, for your rebaptiſing our baptiſed Infants, when you have made them your Proſelytes upon a confeſſion of Faith. What though our Children be baptiſed in ignorance of God, they are yet baptiſed in Covenant with God; if that be a reaſon with you, they muſt be dipt again, and rebaptiſed when they come to knowledge, why were not the Apoſtles ſo, when better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, who were ignorant of the Meſſias, and his kingdom, the death, the reſurrection of Chriſt? will you put your ſelf Sir, or your learned Dippers themſelves upon the tryall, and if you be found ignorant of divers principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, and even fundamental poynts, will you be inſtructed, and Redipped? Alaſſe, Sirs, if as often as God ſhall ſhew you the errors of your Minds, and the enormities of your lives, you
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168478:8"/>muſt be dipping &amp; redipping, dripping &amp; redripping, every Year, Moneth, and Day. No, there is another baptiſm to be uſed in theſe caſes, eye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the waſhing the ſoul with the tears of repentance, dip &amp; re-dip, drip &amp; re-drip in theſe, and renew your repentance dayly. With what a bold face, &amp; high hand dare you, Sir, be either dipt your ſelf now twice, as I hear, or be a dipper of others, again, (as you intend) of thoſe whom you have inveigled &amp; ſeduced away into your Sciſm, &amp; Hereſie, being before rightly &amp; validly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? is not this a multiplying &amp; ſo a vilifying of that o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e baptiſm?</p>
                     <p>What example have you in all the Word of God, of any Infant Jew re-circumciſed, when he came to an ability of profeſſing Faith? and will you tempt God, to put a yoak upon the neck of the Diſciples of Chriſt, which neither our Fathers, nor we were able to bear? Telling us, it is needful to baptiſe baptiſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians again, when they come to be believers, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yea ſinful, to circumciſe Jewes circumciſed, when they came to be the like?

                        <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf allowed it for good and lawfull, and never did he or any other iterate that circumciſion in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or afterwards, upon the profeſſion of its faith; and when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny went over from being Samaritans, who worſhipped they knew not what (as who knew not Jeſus Chriſt) to become Jews,<note place="margin">John 4.</note> or came over to Chriſt, and to the faith of him, none of them were ever baptiſed again, as Beleevers. Your duplicate of baptiſm, doth not only oppoſe the one and ſingle baptiſm of the Apoſtle, but brings Chriſtans under a Tax, and layeth a new yoak upon their necks, as I ſaid before.</p>

                     <p>When of Married Perſons, one forſakes another, &amp; returns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into Love, &amp; both are reconciled, they do not enter into a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168478:8"/>new conjugal Covenant, by any ſolemne Celebration of new eſpouſals, becauſe the firſt conjunction ſtands firm, the reconciliation made; The baptiſm of Chriſtians, is, as the celebration of the Contract betwixt them and Chriſt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom; when ſuch a one, through open abnegation, or other hainous ſins departing away from Chriſt, returns again, with and by a ſerious repentance, there will be no need of being baptiſed again, and ſo a new ſealing of that Covenant, which being once entred into, is ſtill in force and vigor, and by a pious recorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, the Penitent may confirm his Faith, as <hi>Peter</hi> did: and by vertue of the ſame, once eſtabliſhed Covenant, God receiveth ſuch to mercy and grace; otherwiſe the infidelity and impiety of man would fruſtrate the goodneſſe and good will of God, the matter teſtified in baptiſm, which it cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is conſtant, and changeth not, and therefore it is a horrible prophanation of it, to reiterate baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>In a word, Second baptiſm was ever abhorred in the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Church, as a kind of inceſtuous Birth, and if you iterate it, and baptiſe your beleevers again upon their profeſſion of faith, you muſt be able to make their former baptiſm void, and no baptiſm, which you can never do, as having all things therein which God requireth unto Infant baptiſm, Though Faith, a poſitive and actual Faith, as you call for, ſhould not be there, which is not required of God, and therefore is denyed of us to be a neceſſary condition requiſite to be found &amp; manifeſt in every one that is to be baptiſed: indeed in an <hi>Aethiopian Eunuch,</hi> an elder <hi>Gentile</hi> it is, and therefore when he ſaid, ſee here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptiſed, <hi>Philip</hi> anſwered, If thou beleeveſt, with all thine heart, thou maiſt, who anſwering, I beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt, is the Son of God, and ſo <hi>Philip</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8 36, 37.</p>

Is it true that onely beleevers, actually beleevers (as you ſpeak) are the Children of the promiſe, for thus they do not onely at this one blow, beat down all Chriſtian infante from all intereſt in Chriſt, and title to heaven, and make them like as the Heathens, and Pagans (who yet are not wont to ſtrike ſo hard) yea, and which is more, all Jewiſh Infants, <hi>Iſaack, Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> theſe muſt not be, with them, nor were by this reaſon, Children of the promiſe in their Childhood, but only according to the fleſh, untill they did actually believe, and ſo became Children of the promiſe: And more abſurdity yet doth follow hence, that thoſe Patriarks whom I named (<hi>Abraham</hi> is to be here excepted) by their infant-circumciſion, had no promiſe of grace ſealed unto them, but were under a Covenant of works, and until the years of diſcretion and actual fiath, were incapable of any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Covenant of grace: If onely true beleevers and the Elect perſons be under the covenant of grace, &amp; have right to the Sacraments, why is the ſame Covenant of grace inthe outward adminiſtration thereof, both in preaching the promiſes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Seales of the Sacraments, to be propounded by Gods appointment to all the outward viſible members of the Church? And why was <hi>Simon Magus</hi> baptiſed, as I ſaid? 'Tis true, the inward ſaving grace of the Covenant in both Adminiſtrations is by the Holy Ghoſt conferred onely upon the inviſible members of Chriſts myſticall body, which are the true beleevers and elect: But we not able to diſcern of theſe, give the outward baptiſm to all thoſe, I mean all outward members of the viſible Chruch; You muſt do ſo, for the Text before alleged out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> ſheweth, that all they who have any degrees of Faith, may and ought to be baptiſed.</p>
                     <p>But Sir, will you ſtand to your own Tackling, The bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of beleevers? hereby you think and intend to exclude In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168478:9"/>of Chriſtians; What then will you make of them, Infidels, or Beleevers? can you ſhew any Text of Scripture old or new, where any Infant of <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> in Covenant with God, is ſo ſtiled? or can you give any reaſon of it? That which makes an Unbeliever, muſt be a poſitive habit of unbeleef; to juſtifie this in an Infant, will be a task too hard for you, and to ſay that Infants do not beleeve in act, or have not the habit of faith onely negatively, will not in the Language of the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate an Unbeleever.</p>
                     <p>Indeed thoſe that are made Chriſtians of heathens, they muſt give ſome poſitive and actual expreſſions of their faith, before they be baptiſed, (ſo <hi>Philip</hi> required of the <hi>Eunuch</hi>) and not till then are they to be accounted beleevers: but for ſuch as are born Chriſtians of Chriſtians, as our infants are, being entred into and under a gratuitall Covenant with God, we admit them unto the Initial Seal of that Covenant, which is baptiſm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch Teſtimonial Act of Fath, as you require: for they are not Infidels or Unbeleevers; but beleevers, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of your words (though not your ſenſe) the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of beleevers.</p>
                     <p>Seeing you can produce no ſcripture againſt their Faith, I will ſee what I can do for their Faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.5, 6. (Turn to the Chapter and Verſes, and read them, and look to your Neck, in that Verſe, it is a Neck verſe) <hi>Whoſe ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which beleeve on me, it were better for him that a Miſtone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> (Lord what ſhall become of thoſe, that offend all thy little ones, by dobarring and excluding them from their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privilege, and their Right-baptiſm?) But that I aim at, as to you, Sir, is, that you would take notice that our Saviour Chriſt, who beſt knew, knowing the very ſecrets of the heart, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth of ſome little ones, little Children, ſuch as he took out one of them &amp; ſet down in the midſt of the Apoſtles, for a pattern of Humility and Harmleſſeneſs, That they did beleeve in him; its apparent, that (howſoever ſometimes and elſewhere, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Children are meant by little Children, ſuch as are of a meek ſpirit, little in their own eyes,) here and at this time, very natural Children in age, and little in growth, or ſtatute, are ſpoken of, as the very context and Antitheſis do ſhew.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:168478:10"/>
                     <p>They who do ſo interpret this place, do make this not the ſame ſtory with that which followeth, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13. Where little Children are ſaid tob e brought to Chriſt, it may be, in their Mothers armes, and ſo might be leſſer Children than theſe. But the word in the original, for little Children, is the ſame in both Chapters (the like alſo in <hi>Marke</hi> 10.13. (and its acknow, ledged by all, that both in <hi>Mathew</hi> 19. and <hi>Marke</hi> 10. Little Children in age and ſtature are meant) and beſides, ſuch little Children in age and ſtature, were fitteſt to be examples of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Innocency (the thing intended) to the Apoſtles, than either greater Children or grown men, who many times, are ſtubborn and harmfull: And though in Verſe 6. where they are ſaid (To beleeve in me) little ones be mentioned without little Children, it is to me an exegeſis or further explication of the word, Children, that they were little ones, and ſmall oner, (though ſuch as could come to Chriſt upon his calling of them, which maketh no difference in point of the one or the others beleeving in him.) Laſtly, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Who ſo ſhall receives one ſuch little Child in my name, receiveth me; But who ſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones, &amp;c.</hi> The very Antitheſis or oppoſition ſheweth, that he ſpeaketh not of divers ſorts of little Children, but one and the ſame.

But if this be not a Text evident enough for their Faith (as I will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, but ſubject my Spirit to the Spirit of the Prophets,) let another witneſſe ſpeak, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8.

                     <p>Laſtly, I read of two Examples, one in the old Teſtament of <hi>Jeremy</hi> 1.5. Of whom the Lord ſaith, <hi>Before thou cameſt out of the VVomb, I ſanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another in the new, of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who being but a Babe in the Womb of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> leaped for joy of the approach of Chriſt then alſo in the Womb of the Virgin (which joy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was an act of the Spirit in him) Add hereto, <hi>Jacobs</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Eſau</hi> by the heel, which the Prophet <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3. interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to be a kind of ſtriving with him for the Grace and Bleſſing. We cannot think theſe in the Womb, were in Chriſt and ſo ſanctified one way, and when they came to years of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by another way. If Chidlren of Beleevers may thus have the Spirit of Grace and Faith, and that before the Seal of the Covenant, then they are not unbeleevers, but beleevers: Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are ſome things extraordinary in theſe two examples, yet I have ſhewed, that the Spirit of God is an internal ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Agent and means in the Church of God, and as to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantile nature and condition, (which from the two former examples appears to be capable of it) doth where it pleaſeth infuſe Faith and other Graces, as before, Humility, Meekneſſe, Innocency, Patience, (whereof little Chnildren were alſo ſet for examples by our Saviour Chriſt) I do not ſay that any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants now have the Spirit and Graces of the ſame, in ſo ample and large a meaſure, as thoſe above named, as who were ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and conſecrated in a more ſpeciall degree, for a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall work: nor do I ſay that all Infants, now under Covenant, have the Spirit, and this Grace of Faith, and other, but that they who are the Elect of God, and ordained to eternal life (of which there are many) have Faith and the Spirit, ſo far forth, as is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for their Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48.</p>
                     <p>But I will fall upon this poynt more cloſely; and if (as I have in part already, out of the Texts all ged) I can evince this, of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168478:11"/>Infants-Faith (I mean, and ſo muſt you, of Infants in ſpeciality, or in kind ſome of them, ſuch as he purpoſeth to ſave, and not of Infants individually, and in particular every one) Infants Baptiſm muſt needs be alſo evinced. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> about the Reſurrection of the dead, ſo may I to you. Why ſhould it be thought a thing Incredulous with you, that God ſhould give Faith unto Chriſtian Infants? They have knowledge and other Faculties of the Mind, and the Soul, and why may not they have ſupernatural Grace, and ſo ſome ſeeds of the habit of Faith, according to their modell and meaſure, for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of Chriſt, and ſo Faith it ſelf in a kind, and in a like kind, unto that is in grown perſons? (Faith whereſoever, is alike, and but one in kind, the which how ſmall ſoever, ſufficeth to Salvation.) What, doth the weakneſs of the Organ of Body or Soul, make it impoſſible for God to work ſupernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even in the little Children, at leaſt ſo much illumination of the Mind, (more than is ordinary for that age) as may be fit to receive the Grace of Chriſt? I ſhall tell you more Sir, than I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve you know, and I know you will beleeve. Such Infants whom deceaſing, God taketh up into heaven, (for of ſuch alſo is the Kingdom of Heaven, as Chriſt ſaid) he filleth in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at an inſtant, with an inundation of knowledge and underſtanding of Chriſt (for they come to ſight and viſion of him) more than you and I have, nay more than all the Prophets and Apoſtles had, whileſt they lived upon earth. And now cannot the ſame God immediatly before, ſprinkle their Souls with one jot of the knowledge of Chriſt, or one grain of Faith (though but as Muſtard-ſeed) and make them to touch Chriſt, though but with the Tip, or Fingers and of that hand of the ſoul, which is Faith, whom they ſhall immediately have the full fruition of, like as many as touched the Hem of his Garment, were made perfectly whole? But I remember me, you muſt have plain direct Scriptures for this point, one you have had; and ſo you ſhall have more Scriptures, out of which, it may be plainly, and directly evinced, Infants Faith and Salvation by it, which is all one.</p>

                     <p>I ask again, are any Infants in Chriſt? or ingrafted into Chriſt? or the Children of God? if ſo, as you cannot deny it, <hi>for we are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, whether bond or free, male or ſemale, old or young, Father or Children.</hi> And God the Father hath given to Chriſt, Infants and Children, as well as Parents and Fathers: and to thoſe that Chriſt hath received his Father, he gives eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</p>
                     <p>But now <hi>they are all the Children of God, by Faith in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and if they be Chriſt, then are they</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe,</hi> Galat. 3.26, 28 <hi>if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. and he that is none of his, Chriſt Baptizeth not.

And ſurely if Chriſt ſhould not impart unto ſome Infants, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Faith, according to their meaſure Competent to Salvation, but only to the Adule and grown perſons, he might ſeem to be an Acceptor both of Ages, and perſonages, which he is not, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17. Rom. 2.11.</p>
                     <p>See <hi>John</hi> 6.35. and 37. <hi>He that commeth to me ſhall not hunger, and he that beleeveth in me ſhall not thirſt,</hi> immediately Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>whatſoever the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in me; I ask you now, and Quaere you, hath not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his everlaſting Counſel and Bounty given to Chriſt, all his Elect Infants, and appointed them to be Chriſts, when <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee, ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion?</hi> if ſo, why then, they alſo, Infants, being ſomewhat of that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever given unto Chriſt, ſhall come, and do come continually unto him, or beleeve in him, whatſoever you ſay, or write to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168478:12"/>the Contrary, that they neither ſhall, or do believe.</p>
                     <p>See <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath ſhut up all things under ſin, that the promiſe by Faith, in Jeſus Chriſt, might be given to thoſe that believe;</hi> you hear the diſeaſe, of ſin, in <hi>Adam</hi> is ſpread over all things, that is all men, and whatſoever is of and in man, even Infants; therefore the Remedy of Faith in Chriſt, muſt be ſpread over them too, that this may be as generall and large as that, ſo Infants, who are ſaved, muſt and do believe in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>See 17. <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>This is life everlaſting to know thee, the onely true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and univerſal Rule given by Chriſt himſelf, the Author of Salvation, without any inkling, or tinkling of exception, for everlaſting life to be atteined, namely by knowing and believing (for that is alſo included in it) as is ſpecified and more enlarged in the 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, 11, 12 <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life, this life is in the Son, and he that believeth, hath this witneſs in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp;c.</hi> Now I Quaere you again, Have any of the Elect Infants, the Son of God, have they eternall life? you cannot deny it, and therefore you cannot deny them ſome ſpark of Knowledge and Faith.</p>
                     <p>See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>We walk by Faith, and not by ſight,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face,</hi> whence it appeareth, there is but one way of joyning us all to Chriſt, and of our enjoying of Chriſt, which is, Sight of him in Heaven, or Faith in him upon earth, to which Sight, our Faith now is anſwerable, being of the ſame nature and quality, onely differing in the meaſure; for Faith is nothing elſe but a ſight of him, <hi>John</hi> 12.44 and 4. Now I Quaere you again, do not you think, but the ſame way which ſerveth for all the reſt of Gods Elect, doth ſerve for Children alſo, to joyn them to Chriſt? and that there is but one life begun here, which is perfected in heaven, according to that, <hi>He that believeth in me hath eternal life,</hi> John 6.47. Then alſo muſt Infants have ſome light of the mind, to ſee and behold Chriſt now here, as in a looking glaſe, ſo hereafter face to face.</p>
                     <p>See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 6. To all <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed the promiſe is firm by Faith, and his Title is, the Father of the Faithfull, the Scripture maketh him the Father of us all, and all the Children of the promiſe. <hi>(i.e.)</hi> The whole number of Gods Elect (for of that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168478:12"/>Primary cauſe of our Salvation, Gods holy Election, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there diſputeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 8. which is obſervable againſt the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, who impute the Salvation of Infants ſolely to Gods Election, which is acknowledged of us to be the Primary cauſe) whereas in that very place, he mentioneth a ſecondary cauſe of their Salvation, that they are the Children of the promiſe, and ſo reckoned in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, becauſe of that Intereſt they have in that bleſſed Seed, in whom <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his poſterity are partakers of the holy inheritance.)</p>
                     <p>Now I Quaere you again here, do you, or dare you exclude Infants from being <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, you muſt then alſo bar them from having intereſt and part in Chriſt; if not, why do you, or dare you to deny them Faith? ſeeing that in the ſame manner as <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained the Bleſſing (which was by Faith) ſo muſt all Nations of the world, Jews &amp; Gentiles, and every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, all and as many as lay under the curſe before, even Infants therefore, obtain the Bleſſing by Faith, according as it is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.13, 14.</p>
                     <p>What ſhould I run on thus: your ſelf will prove as much for me anon, and agaioſt your ſelf, for in your confutation or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration following upon <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. there you ſay, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Faith anſwereth the promiſe; and I ſhall tell you that Faith anſwereth it, as the condition: If then there be no other way or means for Infants to come by Righteouſneſs, or Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by Faith or believing, (the condition of the Covenant of Grace, and the Goſpel, as works and doing was of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Nature and the Law;) you muſt either grant ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to believe and have Faith, or elſe leave them deſtitute of the ordinary way and means, or ſhew from Scripture ſome other, of their Righteouſneſs and Salvation. Yea if Infants be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, they muſt then be ſaved without Chriſt: for as there is none other name or perſon under Heaven given amongſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>en, whereby we muſt be ſaved, than the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. So there is none other means or grace under Heaven, given amongſt men, whereby we may apprehend the Lord Jeſus, ſave Faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Remember your own words, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Faith anſwereth the Promiſe: If Infants have no Faith to anſwer the promiſe, nor works to anſwer the precept, how ſhall they do for the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168478:13"/>a ſaving Baptiſm, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21? Or what ſhall they do when God riſeth up? and when he visiteth, what ſhall they anſwer him? <hi>Job</hi> 31.14. If he will contend with them, they cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand, <hi>Job.</hi> 9.3 unleſs in Chriſt by Faith they be, and then all is anſwered. I could wiſh ſome others of a more vigorous body and brain, would proſecute theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures to the proof of Faith in Infants, Elect and ſaved, the which (as I take it) would beſt ſtop the mouthes of the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers of Infant-Baptiſm; who now, not ſatisfied with their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant with God alſo, or his giving of ſpiritual grace to them, never leave calling for Faith, Faith in Infants; ſo would it ſet opener and wider, the way of Infants to their Baptiſm, even in the opinion of the adverſaries thereof.</p>
                     <p>If you queſtion how ſuch could believe in Chriſt? Chriſt who tells you ſo, gave them to do ſo, and ſo may give to others. Is thine eye evill, becauſe he is good? may he not do with his own as him pleaſeth? Take that thine is and go thy way, it may be he will give unto this leaſt, even as to thee. Though Intants want the outward Means of Faith, which they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, as the Hearing of the Word, by which Faith ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is gotten, yet there are other beſides; what, you will ſay, extraordinary? and ſo, you will fly now your ſelf to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, who have taxed us of extraordinaries? no ſuch matter; for beſides the ordinary outward Menas of Faith in the Church, which an Infant wanteth, and is not capable of, there are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inward Means of the ſame Faith, which it may find, and of which it is capable, namely Chriſt, the Author of Faith, and the Spirit of Faith, both theſe are internal but ordinary Means of Faith in the Church, and avaylable, when the outward are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the outward unavay leable, where thoſe inward are wanting. But you can diſcern no ſuch matter of Faith in Infants, theſe ſhew no ſuch thing as Faith, what then? what evidence of expreſſion do you ſee, or they ſhew of a reaſonable ſoul in them? by this reaſon you may conclude them, unreaſonable, as well as unbelievers: Even Childrens ſouls are equal, and like as yours and mine are in the eſſentials, which are as large and ample to all intents and purpoſes (though pent up for want of room) as our ſouls are, and are capable of Grace. They are Rational Creatures, Seminally, and in the inward Principle of human
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168478:13"/>Nature, which is a reaſonable Nature, though through defect of age, they are not Rational, Productively, and in the fruits, or external proceedings, or operations of reaſon; and ſo they may be Believers, as to the Root and Fountain of Faith, the Spirit of God, in the firſt act; though they may want the ſecond act thereof, which is the increaſe of it in themſelves, and the deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the knowledge of it to others.</p>
                     <p>So then Infants in the Church, may have Faith, and all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them have (fot it is called the Faith of Gods Elect, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1.) and you as you cannot deſcry it in them, ſo you cannot decry it. Therefore by your own Tenet and Rule, they going for Believers and Elect, may be Baptized; yea, all ought to go ſo, out of a charitable perſwaſion, and opinion that ought to be in us and you, (howſoever it goeth with them, as to the Truth and Reality) and therefore all ſhould be Baptized: for by the ſame reaſon you Baptize any, of thoſe you call Believers, we Baptize all Infants of Believers; and unleſs it were ſo, none at all were to be Baptized: Thoſe that come to you, one by one, in a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, you have but a good and charitable opinion of his Faith and Election; you can have no ſure and certain knowledge of the ſame; (For this and that Perſon, may be an Hypocrite and Reprobate) yet you Baptize him and him. Now therefore, may not we do the like? there comes preſented to us, this and that Child, one and another, in the evidence of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant engraven (as it were) upon them by their birth of Parents in Covenant; we have alſo a charitable perſwaſion of their Faith and Election, and can have no more, (for there are alſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants born in the Church that are Reprobates) and ſo we Baptize them: But if onely the true Beleevers and Elect were to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, then you and we muſt have a certain knowledge of every Infants and every mans Faith and Election, as the ground of our and your Baptizing them; the which becauſe neither we, nor you, can have in any ordinary way, neither of us by this Rule muſt Baptize any at all; You hope the beſt of all, and ſo do we; your old Limitation may do well here, ſo far as man can judge (which in this caſe is juſt nothing) and that's all can be ſaid on both ſides; but ſtill, I muſt prompt you, that it is not knowledge of the Infants, being in Election, and the ſigns of it, or being in the Faith, and the proſeſſion of it, but the being in the Covenant
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168478:14"/>and a relation to it, that is and ought to be the ground of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in the Church of God; now becauſe we find and know all Infants born of Chriſtian Parents, within this Covenant Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (&amp; know not which of them is Elect or not, for if we knew who were Reprobates, we neither would nor ought to Baptize them,) we do therefore Baptize all of them, leſt otherwiſe we ſhould, and might deny the Seal of the Covenant to ſome of the Elect Children of God.</p>
                     <p>Me thinks you, who aſſume ſo much of the Spirit to your ſelves, (Take heed, you do not preſume too much of your ſelves therein) there be they who ſeparate themſelves, having not the Spirit, <hi>Jude</hi> 19.) ſhould not be ſo Covetous or Envious, (and it may be, refiſtous, and then, it is, blaſphemous) as to deny ſome degrees of the Spirit and the graces thereof to Infants, when as the Spirit bloweth where it liſteth, and thou canſt not tell whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goeth: when as alſo the Dove-like Spirit of God, hath a neer compliance with, and a great complacency in Child-like meekneſs, mildneſs, humility, patience (of which graces he is pleaſed to ſtile himſelf the Spirit,) more, than with your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or rather unmanly pride, envy, uncharitableneſs, roughneſs, and preſumption, whereout it is, that you ſo deſpiſe and offend the little ones, withholding them from their due of Bapriſm, &amp; rail and revilethe Churches of God, and the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe things (I tell you) grieve the good, and mild Spirit of God, and ſend it away ſad from ſuch hearts, and at laſt, if preſevered in, will quench its holy fervours.</p>
                     <p>And I wonder very much, that any people ſhould run after you, as they do, who leave their Infants and Children under no better a condition, or denomination, than of Infidels and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: for ſo you tell them, that their condition by nature, and their ſeed, is the ſame which Pagan-Gentiles, and till they know God and believe in him, open and profeſſed enemies of God; whereas upon their and our nature, that is, natural Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Procreation of Seed, there is the Covenant of Grace eſtabliſhed, and ſet up, which you ſee at large, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. and 4, &amp;c. That we were by Nature the Children of wrath as well as others, when out of Covenant, You profeſs much Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Learn to ſpeak in that Holy <hi>Language,</hi> and to call Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſtians, Chriſtians by Nature, and not ſinners of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168478:14"/>Gentiles or Pagans; for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15. We who are Jews by Nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles: (How Jewer by Nature?) becauſe they were the Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and of the Covenant, born under it, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. So are our Children, Chriſtians by Nature (how not ſinners of the Gentiles?) becauſe born Jewes had not their ſins imputed to them, (though born in original ſin, as the Gentiles,) the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being a remedy appointed againſt it, and a means to bring them into Gods favour again; and ſo are our Children, not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>You that are Parents, and are carefull enough to keep ſure your inheritances, and joyntures of earthly things to you and your Children, ſuffer not your Children to be wrangled out of their birth-right, and joynt inheritance they have with your ſelves in the Covenant of Grace, under the name and notion of unbelievers, when as the Scriptures never calleth them ſo, but a holy Seed; and God hath made you, and you Children joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partakers of the Covenant and the Seals thereof.</p>
                     <p>I have been the longer in this, for that I would lay therein ſome ground-work, for ſomething to follow. I will be very ſhort in your next Quaere.</p>

                     <p>YOu ask whether <hi>Baptiſm maketh a man or woman a Chriſtian without Faith, and following of Chriſt in all his Commands and Steps, left upon Record for our imitation?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a ſhort Quaere, and therefore ſhall be ſoon anſwered, as not ſeeing to what purpoſe it is for you or againſt me, I ſhall therefore briefly anſwer ſomething to it out of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28. and 29. diſtinguiſhing of the ſorts of Chriſtians, and the parts of Bapriſm, as he doth of the ſorts of Jews, and parts of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. As Circumciſion which was outward in the fleſh made
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168478:15"/>(though I do not here approve of this your word; and therefore I will uſe another) ſhewed or declared the Jew outwardly, or the outward Jew; ſo Baptiſm which is outward in the fleſh, ſheweth or declareth the Chriſtian outwardly, or the outward Chriſtian; And both may be, without Faith and following of Chriſt in all his Commands, &amp;c. as in <hi>Eſau;</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the one Circumciſed, the other Baptized.</p>
                     <p>Again, As Circumciſion which is of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the Letter, made (for here your word may go) a Jew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or the inward Jew; So Baptiſm which is of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the water onely, maketh a Chriſtian inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the inward Chriſtian; neither of theſe can be without Faith which parifieth the heart, or the fruits of Faith in following of Chriſt, &amp;c. Now as the Apoſtle ſaith ſurther, He is not a Jew, and that is not Circumciſion, ſo may I, He is not a Chriſtian, and that is not Baptiſm, namely approved of God, and avayla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Salvation, which are outward onely and literal; and therefore every true Jew or Chriſtian, muſt indevour after Faith and Following Chriſt (to ſpeak as you do) and to find, and get the inward and ſpiritual ſubſtance and nature of theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is, to worſhip God in Spirit, to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in Chriſt Jeſus, having no confidence in the fleſh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. to put off the ſinſull body of the fleſh, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. That we may draw neer with a true heart in full affurance of Faith, having our hearts ſprinckled from an evill Conſcience, and our bodies waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in pure water, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. and may have the waſhing of Regeneration, and the Sprinkling of the Blood of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus within us, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                     <p>Again, There are Made Chriſtians, and there are Born Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or a Proſelytical or Parental Chriſtianity. As for ſuch who are of the Pagan and Heathen world by Nature, They can no otherwiſe be made Chriſtians, or Members of the Church, but by a lawful Baptiſm, upon their acceſſion unto the Church and expreſſion of their Faith, ſo the Proſelvtes of old were and did: whom Baptiſm made Chriſtians and outward members of the viſible Church upon their Confeſſion of Faith, like as their Faith, if true, made them Saints and inward members of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church. But for them Infants, who are in the Church and within the Covenant, deſcended of Parents and in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168478:15"/>theſe are Born Chriſtians and Church-members viſible. I mean not as born of Chriſtian Parents, but as born in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Chriſtian Covenant; ſo that their Baptiſm doth not ſo much make them to be Chriſtians, but only ſhew and declare them to be ſuch (as I ſaid) and ſeal them as Covenanters. And howſoever a Poſitive expreſſion of Faith explicitely be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto a Heathen Born, for his Admiſſion unto his Chriſtianity or Church-memberſhip, yet it is not ſo unto a Chriſtian Born; for their Chriſtanity, or Church-memberſhip, is their Birth-Privilege; and Baptiſm is but their Inſtalment or inrolment, and is but as the Inauguration or unction unto a Prince Born.</p>
                     <p>Faith I confeſs, and I mean ſaving and juſtifying Faith (and ſo muſt you, ſeeing you joyn thereto, the following of Chriſt in all his Commands and Steps left upon Record for our Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is abſolutely requiſite unto Born Chriſtians, as a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their partaking and enjoyment of the Benefits and Fruits of Baptiſm, but not abſolutely required, as the condition to their comming and engaging to the Covenant, to the which they have a good Title and Right, without preſent actual Faith; unleſs you will affirm that all the Jewes, who came to Circumciſion, had the like, and all the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> man, woman, and child, who <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. entred into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, had a ſaving and a juſtifying Faith.</p>
                     <p>In a word; Baptiſm without Faith may declare a viſible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but incompleatly, as without Faith. Faith without Baptiſm, may make an inviſible Chriſtian but incompleatly, as without Baptiſm: Faith and Baptiſm together, both make a Chriſtian compleatly, and that both Viſible and Inviſible.</p>
                     <p>Are not Children of the Heathens born Heathens? and why then are not Children of Chriſtians, born Chriſtians? I mean, it is theiri Birthright to be ſo eſteemed; or they are to be eſteemed ſuch, by their Birth-right, to be reputed within the Covenant of Grace, or members of the viſible Church. Is the condition of a Chriſtians Child worſe now under the Goſpel, than a Jewes Child was under the Law? the Children of the Jewes were born Jewes, and it was their Birth-right to be Iſraelites, viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> whereupon the Apoſtle calleth them, Jews by Nature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15. As before I have ſaid, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24. He calls the whole Nation of the Jewes, the Natural
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168478:16"/>branches of the Olive-tree, in that they were the vifible Church of God; ſo the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. Thoſe that are born of holy Parents are called holy, yet ſinners but in divers reſpects; by Nature, and as generated of their Parents, ſo ſinners, for Parents do not generate by Grace but Nature: but by Grace, and as received by God into Covenant, ſo Holy, for God ſaid, I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed, and if the root be holy, then are the brancher, no repugnancy here; like as the Circumciſed generateth an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant with a fore-skin; and as wheat dreſſed and clean bringeth forh wheat with chaffe upon it; ſo a Chriſtian bringeth forth one, that is not a Chriſtian, who is therefore Baptized that he may be made Chriſtian, which is when he is Ingrafted into the body of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. That we were by Nature the Children of wrath, as well as others: it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, we may be ſuch, and yet born Chriſtians too, and Holy in an externall Covenant, being born of believing Parents; if you would but remember the ordinary diſtinctions that are given, they would diſperſe this miſt before your eyes, and cleer them matter to you I will give them you; as thus, as there is a Jew, ſo there is a Chriſtian without and in open view, of the Church and as Jew, ſo a Chriſtian within and in ſecret, &amp; before the face of God; as none were born Jewes, ſo none are born Chriſtians in this ſecond and later ſenſs, thus we muſt be made Chriſtians, neither could or can we claim it by Birth-right: but in the firſt ſenſ, which is that whereof the Aſſertion is, we may; even all that have a viſible Birth and ſtanding under the Covenant of Grace, are Chriſtians, and Holy in the face of the viſible Church, though (perhaps) not ſo in the face of God, but many, for all this, may be Children of wrath. Your mind, as your words, runneth onely upon the Internal part of the Covenant, which are inward ſaving graces, which belong only to the Elect; and becauſe we know not, what theſe Infants are born with, we ſay not, that thus they are born Chriſtians; where you ſhould take notice of an external part of the Covenant, which is a true viſible memberſhip, and Birth-Holineſs, which known to us and appearing to all, we call them born Chriſtians as who from their Birth, are to be accounted and reputed viſible members and patts of the Church.</p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:168478:16"/>
                     <p>For the Covenant of Grace is largely to be underſtood and; Taken for the whole diſpenſation of it in-outward Ordinances and under the Notion of its external Privileges, as well as in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Graces, and under the notion of its internal powers. You moſt an end, and in this Quaere eſpecially, uſe the Covenant, as <hi>Hanun</hi> did the ſervants of <hi>David,</hi> ſent to comfort <hi>Hanun,</hi> and to honour his deceaſed Father, who ſhaved off the one half of their Beards, and cut off the half of their Garments, and ſo ſent them away, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.4. So do you, and yours; you leave out in your writing and diſcourſes, the one half of the Covenant, and ſtill reſtrain it to the inward and ſpiritual part thereof, whereas it was ſent whole and entire of God, with an outward and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part alſo, for the further Honour and Comfort of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents and their Children.</p>
                     <p>But I come to the laſt, your firſt Queare of the three about Baptiſm as you propound them; but my laſt of the three, as I handle your matters; and this it is.</p>

Did you keep ſuch a bluſtring in ſeven whole Quaeres together, about the commands and precepts of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, and their examples, (which I took as your preparative and Preface, unto this your particular Quaere of Infant-Baptiſm) and doth the wind go down, in this ſoft and ſtill voyce, What warrant have you for it? After all your former Thundrings out the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God againſt us, as if we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> had broken them all, and had pieced them up with our Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and additions, as Infant-Baptiſm and the reſt, is this your only Thunderbolt you have to ſtrike us down with? what warrant have you for it, out of the word? Your friends and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168478:17"/>lowes, will give you no thanks for this word (if it were not they that gave it you, word and work and all) who as the Jewes cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, ſo they go up and down, and cry, a Precept of the word, a Precept of the word for your Infant-Baptiſm; and do you come after them and behind, and ſo ſoftly ſpeak, for fear they ſhould hear you, a Warrant out of the word, a Warrant out of the word for the ſame?</p>
                     <p>This made me look back over your other Quaeres about our Miniſtery, our maintenance; and I find upon ſuch Review, that this word, Warrant, is uſed and prefixed before them all, and not a word of a Precept or Command. I ſee I have been much miſtaken, who, when I might have put off you and all your Quaeres, with a Warrant, according to your demand, have put my ſelf to ſuch trouble, as to ſearch the Scriptures, and ſend you Precepts and Commands out of the ſame for every particular. You are beholding to me, for I have gratified you herein, in giving you more than you required, and in ſpending more upon you than you deſired, I will not ſay deſerved. I hope you will make good uſe of my Indulgence herein; and not expect for time to come, that I ſhall do the like ſtill. No, you will now give me Leave to take and make my advantage of the word, which I have loſt hitherto, and you have gained hereby.</p>
                     <p>For (I take it) there is a great deal of diſtance and difference twixt a Warrant out of Gods word, and a Command or Precept out of the ſame; I ſhall (I hope) bring you forth ſome warrants out of the word for our Baptizing Infants; but for a Precept or Command for the ſame, I am not engaged, no nor required to give by this your Quaere. Warrants enough, and thoſe from the word, I ſhall ſerve upon you; for though a Warrant from a Juſtice, be a Precept Miſſive, yet a Permiſſive will of God, which is no Precept for it, may be a Warrant of an Action; and ſuch are and may be, any ſolid Reaſon, or good Conſequence or like example drawn there from, which though it will not be admitted for a Precept, may ſerve for a Warrant.</p>
                     <p>A. firſt Warrant, ſhall be this Reaſon, which is but a recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or recapitulation of ſomewhat immediatly ſaid before. If Infants of Chriſtians are all of them capable, and ſome of them partakers of the Spirit, and Faith, and other inward Graces,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:168478:17"/>Then they may and ought to be Baptized; This is warranted out of the word and thoſe Texts, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. The one warranting Baptiſm, to a believer; the other to him, who hath received the Holy Ghoſt, whether young or old, Infant or grown perſon: <hi>If Thou believeſt</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Philip) <hi>thou mayeſt be Baptized;</hi> when the Eunuch asked, what doth hinder me? ſo Faith it was that made him capable, and removed the hindrance, though upon his confeſſion of his Faith, it being not otherwiſe diſcernable, he having no other right pleadable, he being one o'the Gentiles, He was actually Baptized. So can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be Baptized, who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Holy Ghoſt as we? and ſo he Commanded them to be Baptized.</p>
                     <p>That particular Hypothetical, (if thou believeſt, &amp;c. thou may'ſt be Baptized) may and muſt be reſolved into this general Categorical, whoſoever Believeth, may be Baptized, Man or Child, Young or Old; and howſoever, <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the reſt, their receiving of the Spirit, was in the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, then manifeſting it ſelf that way, yet any other manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Spirit, any word or act of God declaring, that Perſons do belong to Gods Covenant, (as ſome or other way, the Spirit doth manifeſt it ſelf in all that do belong to Gods Covenant) is to us and ought to be to you, a ſufficient Warrant without any danger of will-worſhip to account them ſuch, and therefore to Baptize them, be it this pouring out of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry giſts, as here upon <hi>Cornelius</hi> and others; or the Conſeſſion of Faith, as in <hi>Philip;</hi> or Repentance, as in thoſe that came to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; or be it a promiſe to believing Parents-and their Seed, to be their God, or Gods owning them as Perſons belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church, or any other ordinary Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, or the Spirits ſupplying, their infirmities: in theſe caſes can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? This Interrogative, and quaeſtionipropounding Speech, may and muſt be reſolved into a Nagative-Anſwer, abſolutely: No man can forbid water, rightly (for that's done, that is rightly done, or done of Right) anleſs he will forbid that, which God hath Commanded? and ſome of theſe we have abundantly for the Infants of believing Parents; where no man can forbid, there God Commands; that they, who have received the Holy
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168478:18"/>Gholſt, ſhould be Baptized; The reſule alſo out of this, is this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Propoſition, whoſeever (whether Infant or grown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,) hath received the Holy Ghoſt (whether apparently or ſecretly, ordinarily or miraculouſly, whether in ſight or Faith) hath a right to Baptiſm, no man can forbid it; and in one of the particulars, <hi>Peter</hi> here Commands it. See, how I have gratified you, beyond a Warrant, with a little leſs than a Command for the Baptizing of Infants, if having Faith and the Spirit, as many, yea, all the Elect of them have, whom, we not able to know one from the other particularly, do therefore Baptize all under the Covenant with God.</p>
                     <p>More briefly and ſyllogiſtically thus take it, as I recollect it.</p>
                     <p>All Perſons who have received the Holy Spirit, or have Faith, are Commanded by God in Scripture to be Baptized; as appears by the two Texts here cited.</p>
                     <p>But ſome Infants of Chriſtians have received the Holy Spirit, or have Faith; as appears by many Texts formerly cited.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſome Infants are Commanded by God in Scripture to be Baptized.</p>
                     <p>A Second Warrant, is This Reaſon. It Infants of Chriſtian Parents, be in the Holy Covenant of God, and have the ſame engraven upon them, and eſtabliſhed with them, Then they are to be Baptized, and to receive Baptiſm as the initial ſeal thereof: This Reaſon is warranted, or this warrant may be reaſoned out of the word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. &amp;c. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. for its there appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent (and the light there ſhining dazzles all Antipaedobaptiſts, they cannot abide to look thereon) that as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Proſelytes, grown men, upon their profeſſion of their Faith, were Circumciſed, ſo the ſeed or Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> and thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, were Circumciſed as Children of Parents in Covenant, and joyned together with them in covenant; and both theſe are there expreſly Commanded; and ſo this alſo, that the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Proſelytes ſhould be Circumciſed, by vertue and reaſon of Gods Covenant with them, which was to be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto them by Circumciſion. Now as the Being of Infants in Covenant under the Law, made them capable of, and gave them a due Right to Circumciſion, the Initial ſeal of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under the Law; ſo the being of Infants in Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168478:18"/>the Goſpel, makes them capable of, and gives them a due or Right to Baptiſm, the Initial ſeal of the Covenant under the Goſpel; The Covenant being the ſame, for ſubſtance, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the eternal wel are of the Soul (as in the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>x I ſhall ſhew:) which being ſo, if Anabaptiſts paſſing by this reaſon from the Covenant, will inſiſt ſtill upon the meer and ſole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, I muſt tell them, the Text ſaith not, Thou ſhalt keep my Command, but thou ſhalt keep my Covenant; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that this Command of Circumciſion had reference to the Covenant, and was part of it. For here God is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, not in his abſolute Prerogative commanding, but as God in reſpective mercy Covenanting with his people, and all his Commands, are to be taken as branches of his Covenant, and all prounded upon his Free-grace in Jeſus Chriſt, therefore <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. and 13. God calls expreſly Circumciſion by the name of his Covenant, to teach you and all others that will learn, that the Covenant made Infants capable of the Seal, and not Gods meer Commandement, as you and your notional, and metaphyſical Maſters do abſtract, who love to play with your own Fancies and Imaginations, whereas the Seal is nothing but the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant, and appointed and commanded ſo to be of God. But the Covenant, in order of Nature going before the Seal thereof, their being in Covenant, muſt needs be the ground of Gods commanding the Seal of Circumiſion.</p>
                     <p>It is acknowledged there was a ſpecial Commandement for circumciſing in the time of Infancy; but do not you blame God for his ſuch Command, by the ſame reaſon you blame us for our practice? Infants of Jewes were as much in the ſtate of Nature, as ignorance, blindneſs, and under the ſame defects, that Infants of Chriſtians are; and why do ye not charge the wiſdom of God with folly, for Commanding the Infants of Jewes to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed? or excuſe us who being under the ſame Covenant, do Baptize the Infants of Chriſtians, In imitation of God, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Circumciſion, and alſo in obedience of God and that Command, which was in part alſo Evangelical. For</p>
                     <p>That Commandement was for the Circumciſing of ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in their Infancy, whoſe Parents were under Gods ſeal, but there is no ſuch command for Infants, whoſe Parents were not; for theſe, Profeſſion of Faith was needful, <hi>Abraham</hi> (in whom
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168478:19"/>the Church of the Jews began) therefore had Faith, before hee took the Seal, but no ſuch thing was afterward required of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> Seed, but the contraty Commanded, namely that their Seed ſhould be circumciſed in their Infancy.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I deny not, but God Commanded Circumciſion; but this, that by vertue of Gods Commandement onely, they were Circumciſed, I deny, for it was alſo and chiefly, becauſe of the foregoing Covenant in the 7. and 8. verſes, to which the words refer, ſaying, Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant. Therefore (what Covenant? verſ. 10. Circumciſion, is ſo named) He doth not barely Command it, but with an Inference or reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſhew that, they being in Covenant, were therefore to have the Seal thereof, Circumciſion, which did but put the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under Seal, in which Covenant thoſe Children were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Birth, being born of Parents with whom God had ſtricken Covenant. But I ſhall go neer to make uſe of it anon for the Baptizing of our Children, like as they and you do now, for the circumciſing of the Jewes Chrildren, Though (the Truth is) that was nothing but Gods word of Inſtitution, whoſe incommunicable property it is to appoint Sacramental Signs. The Covenant then eſpecially was the ground of Circumciſing the Seed of the Jewes, and the ſame is the ground of Baptizing the Infants of Chriſtians: and ſo Chriſtian Parents, being in Covenant, their infants are in Covenant with God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptizable; for Gods Covenant written upon Children of Parents in Covenant, is no Blank to ſeal too, but a juſt Title (or writ, as I may ſo ſay) for the Seal, and a very Commiſſion given out by the Holy Spirit, for the Baptizing Infants of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their lofarcy; and ſo theſe things appearing to the Churches of God, That Infants of Chriſtians are entred in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, They ought to put the ſame under the Seal of Baptiſm, as the Infants Due, and the Churches Duty.</p>
                     <p>More briefly and Syllogiſtically thus take it, as I recollect it.</p>
                     <p>All perſons within and under the Covenant of Gods Grace, are Commanded of God, to have the Seal of Covenant put upon them, which in the Goſpel-adminiſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>But all Infants of Chriſtians, are within the Covenant of Gods grace.</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:168478:19"/>
                     <p>Therefore all Infants of Chriſtians, are Commanded of God to have the Seal of the Covenant put upon them, which in the Goſpel-Adminiſtration thereof is Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Propoſition is clear from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all Jews in Covenant to be Circumciſed; and from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and Chriſt Commanding all Gentiles, or Nations in Covenant to be Baptized.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Propoſition, is the very Tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed; and ſo I have reaſoned the Baptiſm of Infants and Terms, into a Command of God, before I intended it.</p>
                     <p>A third Warrant is this Reaſon; If the Infants of Jewiſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, were capable of Circumciſion, the initial Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which was Circumciſion, and were Circumciſed, though they could ſhew no Right they had unto it, but their Birth of Parents in Covenant. Then alſo may, and muſt, the Infants of Chriſtian Parents, be Baptized and receive Baptiſm, the initial Seal, though they can ſhew no other Right to it, but their Birth of Parents in Covenant: This Warrant is Reaſoned out, or this Reaſon is warranted out of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt miniſtred is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is (as I ſaid) the ſame for ever in ſabſtance, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to theeternal welfare of ſouls; Though the miniſtrations of him be different, of him as to be exhibited and to come, unto the Jewes, and of him, as come and exhibited, unto Chriſtians; And though ſome Ceremonial and Circumſtantial matters be changed, yet the ſubſtantial, and that which was purely a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venantall or Sacramental Part, abides, as being an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant made with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, all true beleevers: they differ not, the Two Sacraments, in any ſubſtantial thing, or in any ſpiritual effect neceſſary to ſalvation, or in any uſe to confirm the Covenant of Grace, and further a man in the way to Heaven, and ſo, as an Initial Seal of the Covenant, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not, nor as a Sacrament of entrance, into the Church; and ſo Circumciſion was a Seal of the ſame Righteouſneſs by Faith, as Baptiſm is to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. and Circumciſion ſignified the mortification of the fleſh, and the renewing of the mind, and did bind over the Jewes unto the obedience of Gods will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28. &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. and ſo doth Baptiſm the ſame to us now, as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168478:20"/>
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. and 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Inſomuch that Baptized Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are called circumciſed Chriſtians; and Baptiſm is called by the name of Circumciſion, <hi>Col.</hi> 2 11. and 14</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though we Chriſtians are not to follow the Jews in things peculiar to his own diſpenſation, which was Legal and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial; yet thoſe actions that were done by them upon ſuch grounds that are of moral, perpetual and common concernment to one perſon, as well as another, in one Church, as well as another, for one age as well as another; none can deny ſuch actions to be binding and obligatory to all, as a ſtanding Rule for after Generations; by which may be anſwered that which is uſually objected by thoſe that except to our Analogy of Baptiſm with Circumciſion, as why do ye not plead a Baptiſm of Males onely; and that, particular of the eight day, and ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the whole Analogy together and in order? why, becauſe, theſe were but circumſtantial things, the two Sacraments may be one in ſubſtance for all theſe; beſides they were not of common, but peculiar uſe to the Jews, that Church, thoſe ages; as for the eighth day, it was both a Ceremonial and Phyſical reaſon, as to life and health of the infant that thefore skin was not cut off till then; and for the Females not Circumciſed, it is enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you and your opinion, if the proportion betwixt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and Baptiſm holds but in the Males, for that will infer the ſtate of infancy capable of the Initial Seal of the Covenant of Grace under the Goſpel; and again, under the Law, becauſe of the inconveniency and unfimeſs of the thing it ſelf to be done upon them, the Females were Circumciſed in the Males, as the Church is circumciſed in Chriſt, the Males bearing the Type of Chriſt upon their fleſh; and the Males and Females in Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial conjunction repreſenting Chriſt and his Church, to which the Apoſtle alludes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5 22 and 33. but now ſuch a typical diſcrimination of Sexes being removed, Chriſt exhibited puts no difference in Baptiſm between Males and Females, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 27 and 28.</p>
                     <p>Nor yet do we Argue for Infant-Baptiſm, from the bare Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Infantcircumciſion, but from the force of the reaſon, that lyeth in the performance, which holds not in the circumſtances of the eighth day and the Females, as it doth in this, of Infancy. Namely, that as Infants of the Jews were circumciſed, though
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:168478:20"/>they declared no right they had unto it, but their birth; ſo may the Infants of the Chriſtians be Baptized, though they make no manifeſtation of their Faith, &amp;c. but ſhew their birth, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Parents in Covenant with God.</p>
                     <p>Yea the Foundation and occaſion of both, Circumciſion and Baptiſm, were one &amp; the ſame, of common concernment to all; (to adde ſomewhat left out before, wherein they differ not;) namely Gods free eternal Love to his Elect, and mans miſery by his fall in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his birth in pollution from the loynes of his immediate Parents derived to them from the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> whence alſo I may argue, the original ſin, and the clenſing of Nature by the Spirit of Chriſt, are of Common concernment to Jewiſh and to Chriſtian Infants: Therefore Chriſtian Infants ought to the made partakers of the Seal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in their Infancy, as the Jewiſh Infants were; and ſo there lyeth as much neceſſity in ſubſtance, yea morality in the duty for believing Chriſtians to Baptize their Infants, as for believing Jewes to circumciſe theirs; but of this particular, I ſhall ſay more preſently.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If now for all this, you ſhall deny and withold Baptiſm from the Infants of covenant-Chriſtians, in their Infancy, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that God granted, yea commanded Circumciſion to the Infants of covenant Jewes in their Infancy, (but by reaſon of the covenant, which God made with the Parents and their Seed,) You muſt of neceſſity do one of theſe abſurdities yea Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, <hi>i.e.</hi> either you muſt deny Gods covenant of Grace under the Law and the Goſpel, to be one and the ſame for ſubſtance, and theſe, circumciſion and Baptiſm to be the Initial Seales of it according to the diverſities of the adminiſteations of the ſame, which is unreaſonable and unwarrantable, as is ſhewed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or you muſt charge God with want of wiſdom and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in managing his affairs, for chooſing ſuch unfit and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie parties as Infants to make a covenant with and to Seal too; which is, Irreligious and Impious to do.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Or you muſt prefer the Typical Adminiſtration before the Evangelical, and ſo advance <hi>Moſes</hi> above Chriſt, and the ſhadow before the Sun-light, by denying the Infants of Gods covenanted people under the Goſpel, and ſince Chriſts comming the Initial Seal of the Covenant, and ſo making the Grace of leſs extent,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:168478:21"/>than that which <hi>Moſes</hi> allowed the Infants under the Law, and before the comming of Chriſt, which is unchriſtian and un-Goſpel-like to do.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Or you muſt put our Children born in the bright day of the Goſpel, and of more abundant Grace, into a worſe eſtate and Condition, as to the meanes of their Salvation; if they be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Seal and not baptiſed, then the Children were, who were born in the Twi-light of the Law, who were admitted to the Seal &amp; Circumciſed; which is envious and malicious to do:</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Or you muſt ſhew, that a manifeſtation of Faith, and ſome perſonal Righteouſneſſe, is now more requiſite. (Which was onely required of ſuch, whoſe Parents were not under the Faederal Seal) unto the baptiſm of our Infants, than it was unto the Circumciſion of their Children; or that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren gave at their Circumciſion, ſuch Teſtimony of their Faith and Righteouſneſſe more than ours. Which is even fooliſh and childiſh to think.</p>
                     <p>This Warrant of our Infant-baptiſm, from its Analogy with this Infant-Circumciſion, lyeth as ſuch a Block in your way, as neither you, nor any of yours, could ever get over, as Chriſt crucified on the Croſſe, was unto the Jewes a ſtumbling Block. So Chriſt miniſtred in Circumciſion, unto the Jewes in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and their Infants, is to you and all Antipaedobatiſts, a very ſtumbling Block, which whileſt they have endeavoured to lift at, and leap over, they have ſtrained and ſtretched and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Scriptures more than their Armes, and have broken their ſhins, I mean, their firſt Faith and a good Conſcience, making ſhipwrack of both, whileſt they ſlit upon this Rock, or ſtumble upon this Block.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, I hope better things of you, and I have better things for you, as my Friend and Neighbour: I will not leave you in the maze of the five-went way of the Anabaptiſts that they muſt walk in; I have a ſingle path and a plain way for you, if you pleaſe to take it, and it is this, or none.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. You muſt yeeld in Modeſty and Humility, at it becomes you, to beleeve ſuch parties, Infants of both Teſtaments to be inabled by God, with ſome proportionable Grace, for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Seals, in a way acceptable to himſelf. Though you cannot ſee it, nor have Capacity, (I will not ſay Inpenuity) to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168478:21"/>acknowledge it, and to clear off all Clouds of Doubts and Quaeres, which you or others have raiſed up and gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, about the manner and manifeſtation thereof, and for this purpoſe read, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.13, &amp; 14. <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.8, and 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34, &amp; 35. <hi>Ro.</hi> 12.3, &amp; 16 And of this I have largely before diſcourſed, more briefly and Syllogiſtically thus take it, as I recollect it.</p>
                     <p>If all Infants of Jewes are commanded in Scripture to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and their Parents thereupon bound to bring them to Circumciſion, Then alſo all Infants of Chriſtians are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be baptiſed, and their Parents bound to bring them to baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>But all Infants of Jewes are commanded in Scripture to be circumciſed, and their Parents bound to bring then to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Therefore all Infants, of chriſtians are commanded to be baptiſed, and their Parents bound to bring them to baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Propoſition is clear from the cited Texts of <hi>Hebrews</hi> 13.9. and <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 2.11. and from the Analogy of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and baptiſm, and the ſameneſſe or identity of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of both Adminiſtrations, in the ſubſtantials, as to the good of Souls.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Propoſition, is the very Letter of the Text, in the ſeventeenth of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and elſewhere as hath been ſhewed: and ſo I have reaſoned Infant-baptiſm into a command, before I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                     <p>A fourth Warrant is this Reaſon; If Baptiſm be a means and Remedy to free Chriſtian-Infants from originall ſin, as to guilt and puniſhment, and the dominion thereof in them, that are E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ect and Beleevers, Then ſuch are and ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, The Church or Miniſter of it, knowing nothing of this and that particular Infant, but he or ſhe may be ſuch. This Warant is reaſoned out of Gods Word, or this Reaſon is War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted out of Gods Word, <hi>Romans</hi> 6.3.4, 5, 6. verſes. <hi>We as many of us, as were baptiſed into Christ, were baptiſed into his death; therefore we are buried with him by baptiſm into his death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead, ſo we ſhould walk in newneſſe of life, &amp;c. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt here add a little explication, leſt there may be a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:168478:22"/>conſtruction of ſome Popery: The Popery in this poynt is this, That baptiſm taketh away original ſin, that it ceaſeth after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be a ſin properly, and is nothing but a defect or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which maketh the heart fit and ready to conceive ſin, like Tinder which is not Fire, but is apt to conceive Fire: This I abandon, as Popery and an Error. But this I aver, as Truth and Proteſtancy.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That after baptiſm, in the Elect Infants, original ſin is taken away, as to the puniſhment of it, for there is no <hi>condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.1.</item>
                        <item>2. As to the guiltineſſe of the perſon, there being nothing to bind them to puniſhment, if no ſuch condemnation.</item>
                        <item>3. As to the dominion of it, it ſhall not reign in their mortal bodies, nor they ſerve it.</item>
                        <item>4. As to the Imputation of it, it ſhall not be imputed to them, but be pardoned, and in that reſpect, be as if not.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>But for all this, original ſin or concupiſence, remaines in the Elect Infants, even after baptiſm, and ever after, and is ſtill ſin and properly ſin, ſome limbs and portions, of the old man, and the body of ſin remain, even where he is ſaid to be crucified and deſtroyed, in the manner above, and there are and will be defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in them that are waſhed: I muſt enlarge no farether here.</p>
                     <p>However this may be a comfort to Beleevers, that in Chriſt the promiſed ſeed (who ſhould and did break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, which in ſome good ſenſe, I may call original ſin,) there is pardon of this ſin, to their natural ſeed; and therefore Chriſt was alſo born, not in the ordinary way, as others of Mankind, but of a Virgin, as conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, that ſo being free himſelf from original &amp; all ſin, He might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the pardon of the ſame, and be a plea againſt it. Yea, though Infants in preſent have no actual ſins, yet their baptiſm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its vertue to the taking away alſo of the guilt, puniſhment, dominion, and imputation of ſins to come, ſo the party baptiſed ſtand to the order &amp; terms of Baptiſm, which is to turn to God, beleeve actually in Chriſt, and continually renew repentance, as the place above mentioned imports, <hi>Romans</hi> 6.4. and thus bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ſaveth, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.21. (So doth baptiſm ſeal the Pardon,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:168478:22"/>as of original, ſo alſo of actual ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaid to <hi>Paul, Ariſe and be baptiſed, and waſh away thy ſins, calling upon the name of the Lord.</hi> Oh but we commit <hi>ſins dayly after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> &amp; that after juſtification, &amp; will the Lord continue to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuch ſins? yes if we continue to repent of, and purge away ſich ſins. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 8. If we confeſſe our ſins he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt to forgive us, how faithful and juſt to forgive ſin? it implyeth that he hath ſomewhere bound himſelf by promiſe to do it, and where and when but in baptiſm, and to whom but the party baptiſed, ſo far as ſin is repented of? when the Conſcience makes any queſtion, whether God will continue to pardon ſin, the waſhing of Baptiſm doth ſeal the aſſurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the perſon baptiſed may ſay, I am aſſured of it, I have it ſealed to me, ſo many years ago, at the time of my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo a popiſh device, who tell you that Baptiſm onely ſerveth for Remiſſion of ſins done before, and therefore for ſins does after they muſt have a Sacrament of Penance, diſtinct from Baptiſm, appointed for a remedy: For the Sacramental force of Baptiſm doth extend it ſelf to the whole life, that is, to be a Seal unto them of Remiſſion of ſin in the blood of Chriſt: And the confeſſion of ſin is but a more effectual application of the force of Baptiſm, like as the people who were baptiſed of <hi>John,</hi> confeſſed alſo their ſins; And therefore there needs no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Repentance, or Penance, to be ſet up for this purpoſe after Baptiſm, to be a ſecond Table, for Refuge after ſins actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally committed, like as they ſay, making Baptiſm but the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Refuge after original ſin contracted: For Baptiſm it ſelf, is the Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. (Chriſts baptiſm being not different from <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, as is ſhewed) as which teacheth and ingageth us to dye unto ſin, and riſe unto newneſſe of lie, <hi>Romans</hi> 6.4. Which is nothing but Repentance, which is called, Repentance from dead workes, and ſo a riſing from them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.</p>
                     <p>It would therefore much promote the good cauſe of Infant-Baptiſm, if the Doctrin of original ſin eſpecially, (&amp; alſo actual) were preſſed and urged upon People and Parents, eſpecially a little more, and they heard oftener, how all Men, and Women, and Children, born in the ordinary way, ſin <hi>Adams</hi> fall, are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:168478:23"/>born in the guilt of original ſin, and have a ſinfull and polluted being, whoſoever have any being, and may and muſt every one confeſſe with <hi>David, I was born in ſin, and in iniquity hath my Mother conceived me,</hi> (it is plain that he confeſſeth not his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents but his own ſin, this being the ſcope of the whole Pſalm,) &amp; ſo with <hi>Job, Who can bring that which is clean not of that which is unclean?</hi> &amp; that <hi>which is born of the fleſh is feleſh,</hi> &amp; <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit eternal life,</hi> and that by <hi>Nature we are the Children of wrath,</hi> and all Infants, as that in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16. polluted in their bloods, their Fathers are <hi>Adamites,</hi> their Mothers are <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This if preached and preſſed, would ſhew to Parents what great need there is of a New-Birth for their Children, and ſo would lead and drive them to procure for them the outward waſhing in Baptiſm, as a Seal of the inward waſhing away of that natural pollution of ſin by the Spirit: Thus our Saviour Chriſt inforces it unto <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> John 3.5. and that not ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in reference to actual ſin, as original or Birth ſin, the natural pollution in which Infants are born, and I can ſee, no good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the contrary, but that the outward Elementary Baptiſm of Water is here intended as a Seal of the inward waſhing by his Spirit, which is alſo called the waſhing or Laver of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. Becauſe the inward waſhing of the Spirit in Regeneration, is ſealed with the outward waſhing in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I find it, in the Eccleſiaſtick Hiſtories, That in thoſe ages and places, where and when the vileneſſe of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pollution was beſt underſtood of Parents of Children, as moſt preached of by the Fathers of the Church, as in <hi>Auguſtins</hi> dayes, what running there was od Parents with their Children in their armes, to Baptiſm; and why not? there being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible ordinance appointed of God in the Church, but Baptiſm, for the waſhing away the guilt and filth of that Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin and pollution; And was it not ſo of old? wherefore did God command the Infants of the Jewes to be circumciſed, and wherefore were they ſo circumciſed in the fore skin of their fleſh? but to ſhew tht the very nature was defiled, which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by carnal generation from their Parents, and which they were like to traduce and conveigh to their Children, and to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:168478:23"/>what need they had to have ſuch original Corruption, and uncircumciſion of the fleſh, to be done away by the clenſing and Regeneration Spirit of Chriſt, ſealed in their outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: And that Circumciſion in the former, as Baptiſm in the latter diſpenſation, do both poynt at this one and the ſame thing, the Cleming away of the pollution of the natural birth, by the Spirit of Chriſt, there is a clear Text, <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 2.11, 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>We now are fallen into thoſe days, wherein there have been not only ſhaken but raſed many foundations and principles of the Doctrines of Chriſt, eſpecially two of thoſe ſix in <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 6.2. Which are Repentance from dead workes, (a chief of which is original ſin,) and the doctrine of Baptiſm; and wherein a Spirit of <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> hath entred into many, and goeth about preaching unto Parents a freedom from original ſin &amp; pollution in their Infants, as derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo proclaming a liberty from baptifing of them (juſt as the impoſtors foretold of by Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) whileſt they promiſe them liberty, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the Servants of Corruption, 2 Pet. 2.19. It concerneth us therefore ſo much the more, who are Maſter-builders in the Houſe of God, or but Repairers of the breaches, to uphold and maintain theſe two foundations of the Chriſtians Faith, and to teach the people firſt, that as themſelves were, ſo their Children are defiled with original ſin and pollution by their natural birth, and then next, that there is no other ordinary way of clenſing and waſhing them, but by the regenerating and purifying Spirit and Grace of Chriſt Signified, Sealed, and Exhibited in andby the outward waſhing of Water in Baptiſm, as pleaſeth God.</p>
                     <p>Again, I ſay not that Baptiſm doth all this, from or by the deed done, or work wrought, which is their Popiſh phraſe, but (as our Proteſtants ſay) either as it is a means to give &amp; exhibite Chriſt with his benefits, the which it doth by ſignification, as a particular Certificate aſſuring forgiveneſſe of ſins; or as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or pledge of the Grace of God, confirming it. Or as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, becauſe in and with the right uſe of Baptiſm, God confers Grace where and when he pleaſeth (for it is no Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call but a Moral Inſtrument) and ſets his image or mark of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation upon the party, whence Baptiſme is called the Laver
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:168478:24"/>of Regeneration: God is at liberty, and may, when and how he pleaſeth, let his Grace accompany his ordinance of Baptiſm, Which way ſoever God doth work theſe great things, by or in Baptiſm, Methinks, it is, a potent and invincible reaſon and warrant for the bringing Infants upon Baptiſm, the onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miniſterial remedy in the Church, for the abating and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing the malady of original ſin, of which even Infants ſtand guilty, born, and conceived in it, unleſſe you would involve Parents in another guilt, of neglecting the meanes and cure of that diſeaſe, which they were inſtrumental to the bringing their Children into; or elſe that you are of the opinion of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian</hi> Hereticks, who held no original ſin at all in Infants, but actual, which they alſo contracted by Imitation of other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereupon all the Antient and Orthodox Divines, urged and preſſed them, with the Baptiſm of Infants, and made it a foundation and proof, of original ſin in Infants; like as I now go the other way, and urge and preſſe original ſin in Infants, as a proof and plea, or warrant (as you call it) for the Baptiſm of Infants, as being the only outward ordinary way to begin their cure and Rogeneration; more briefly and ſyllogiſtically thus take it as I recollect it.</p>
                     <p>If Baptiſm be commanded of God in the Goſpel for the waſhing away the guilt and filth of original and birth ſin, then all Infants, who are Partakers of theſe, are commanded Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>But Baptiſm is commanded of God in the Goſpel for the waſhing away the guilt and filth of original and birth-ſin.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Infants who are Partakers of theſe, are commanded Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>The firſt propoſition is not queſtionable; the light of Nature and Reaſon, commandeth the uſe of meanes and medicines, to the end and for maladies: the ſick need the Phyſician, &amp;c. Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond propoſition, is the matter of the Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, and 4. and <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. as hath been declared, and ſo I have reaſoned baptiſm of Infants into a command before I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                     <p>Sirs, (I ſpeak to you Parents) are you willing, your little pretty babes ſhould be ſaved? you ſhould be very willing and deſirous of it; and the rather, in that you have been means of conveighing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:168478:24"/>into them, a corrupt ſeed, you ſhould labour, they might be born again of the incorruptible ſeed, by the Word of God, and the Seales thereof, one whereof which is fit for them in their Infantile Eſtate, is this Baptiſm, I am ſpeaking of and for.</p>
                     <p>If you would have them ſaved, it muſt be either without, or with Regeneration; without Regeneration they cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>For Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh,</hi> a degenerate ſinful corrupt thing; neither can corruption iherit incorruption: Therefore they muſt be ſaved with Regeneration, for <hi>except a man be born again of Water and the Spirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 3.3.6.</note> 
                        <hi>He cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit, a Regenerate ſanctified and clean thing. If ſo, the, Sirs, bring forth your Infants and Babes unto the Laver and means of Regeneration, preſent them to the Water of Baptiſm, and wati and pray for the Spirit of God, that it would move upon the face of the Waters, (as it did in the firſt Generation) and ſo form a ſpiritual Light out of or in a natural darkneſſe, That the Baptiſmal Water may be effectual (by and through that Spirit of God) as Waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> were, to the waſhing the Leprofie of original ſin, and as the Waters of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> to the healing of other diſeaſes whatſoever, even their actual ſins alſo, when afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that your Children dying without Baptiſm may be ſaved, by the Coverant and Promiſe of God and his Grace, many are ſo, all are ſo, that are of the Number of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
                     <p>Yea, I confeſſe the hope of ſalvation doth no lie ſo much in the Seal, as in the Covenant and Promiſe to which the Seal is annexed. Indeed the Lord having made a promſe to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Parents, concerning your Children born in original ſin, (That he will be your God and the God of your ſeed) in this caſe you muſt beleeve this his Word and Promiſe: But where he hath ordained a Seal for the confirmation of your Faith, you muſt take heed how you neglect to apply it; you muſt not (as more than too many do in theſe days) think it a ſuperfluous and idle figure, and ſome alſo hold it a ſuperftitious and Idol-ſervice, That which I may and do plead with you for, is this, that you
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:168478:25"/>would ſo account of it, as it is, that there is a neceſſity lying upon you to baptiſe your Children born in original ſin, I mean a neceſſity not abſolute but conditional; in caſe your Children be prevented of Baptiſm by death, you may well hope of the ſalvation of them, by the Promiſe and Covenant onely, as I ſaid, of God and his Grace: and if after Baptiſm they be taken away from you by death, you may better hope of their ſalvation, from both, Covenant and Seal alſo: But if you be careleſſe and negligent, and do alſo (it may be) purpoſely and prophanely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your duty, to put your Children in Covenant with your ſelfs, under the initial Seal thereof, you will very hardly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch your courſe either to God himſelf, or his Church, yea, or to your Children, and (I think at laft) to your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. But in the mean time what blindneſſe and preſumption is this in you, Parents, to tempt God, and to caſt your Children, onely upon the hands of his Spirit, when he hath alſo appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Water, for their Waſhing and Regenerating? this is as if you ſhould throw up your Children unto the top of the Pinnacle of the Temple, when as you have a Ladder ſtanding and reaching up thither to carry them up by or upon; upon this gloſie, God ſhall give his. Angels charge over them, ſo his Spirit order over them, and in their hands ſhall they bear them up, and on his finger ſhall he hold them, leſt at any time they periſh, and come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction bodily or ghoſtly.</p>
                     <p>What Prophaneſſe and impiety is this, in you Parents, to ſlight and refuſe the outward ordinary means of your Childrens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal good, as it may be the freeing of them from the Guilt, Dominion, and Condemnation of original pollution, &amp;c. and to refer them over wholly to the inward ordinary means, Chriſt Jeſus and his Spirit, when as theſe have appointed and dedicated the former, to be uſed and applyed alſo?</p>
                     <p>What careleſneſſe, yea cruelty is this in you Parents, to leave and let your Children lie in the pit, and under the bondage of original and natural pollution, into the which your ſelves have been acceſſary to their falling, and not to ſuffer a hand of Gods ordinance to be reached out unto them, which is Baptiſm, for their raiſing up unto newneſs of Birth and Life?</p>
                     <p>And whereas, God hath made a Covenant with you, for your ſelves and your Children, yea a joynt Covenant with you both,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:168478:25"/>to be your God, and the God of your ſeed, what ingratitude is this, and ungodſineſs to God, what inhumanity or apparent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parentneſſe is this, to with-hold your Children from the Seal of that Covenant, and ſo in a manner, to diſinherit them (as much as in you lieth) of their juſt and due Joynture and inheritance ſpiritual and eternal?</p>
                     <p>Well, be it ſo, your infants dying without Baptiſm may be ſaved, (and I pray God, they may be ſaved) through the Riches of his Grace, but you have not delivered your own ſouls, becauſe you gave no warning to have them baptiſed, as you ought to do, ſeeing the evil come, and more a coming upon them. But, ſuppoſe, you with-holding them from their means of Baptiſm, blow no Trumpet, give no warning to have them baptiſed, God ſhould alſo with-hold his Spirit of Grace from your Children (which God forbid) and your Children be taken away in their infancy and minority, <hi>They ſhall die in their iniquity,</hi> or original ſin, <hi>But their-blood will he require at your hands,</hi> for your negligence &amp; contempt, you <hi>have broken his Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.14. &amp; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.</p>
                     <p>A fifth warrant or reaſon is this; If Baptiſm now under the Goſpel doth ſucceed Circumciſion under the Law, Then are the Infants of covenanted beleeving Parents, to be baptiſed, like as Infants of the covenanted profeſſing Jewes were circumciſed; this warrant is reaſoned out, or this reaſon warranted out of <hi>Colloſſians</hi> 2.11, and 12. Where the Apoſtle plainly ſheweth, that there is no need of their being circumciſed, who were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, Jews or Gentiles, becauſe ſuch baptiſed ones had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Circumciſion made without hands, namely Baptiſm, the better and great Circumciſion, as the Antients call it.</p>
                     <p>If you deny this, you muſt affirm, that the Churches of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and all the Gentiles converted to the faith of Chriſt (of whom eſpecially they conſiſt) are left without a Sacrament of Inititiaon or admiſſion thereinto for their infants, and ſo without one Seal of the Covenant of Grace, which ought not to be, nor is indeed, For the Condition of Chriſtians and their Infants is better, at leaſtwiſe as good under the New Teſtament as the Old; &amp; the Grace of God, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing of Chriſt into the world, is more ample and clear, as ample &amp; clear at leaſtwiſe, to us living under the Goſpel, as to the Jewes living under the Law: To deny theſe things, were to caſt foul dirt into the bright Sun, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:168478:26"/>to ſhoot Arrows of Contumely &amp; Reproach into heaven againſt our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom came Truth and Grace, 1 <hi>John</hi> 17. as the Law was given by <hi>Moſes:</hi> and to grant theſe things, is to yeeld Infant Baptiſm, under the New Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>And whereas it is, or may be replyed, that in that Text above, and others where Biptiſm is conjoyned to Circumciſion as its ſubſtitute and ſucceſſor, there alſo are conjoyned with Baptiſm, Mortification of the Fleſh, Newneſs of Life, Faith and other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mentioned: its eaſily taken off, though one of your moſt difficult Replies, as thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are no more conjoyned with Baptiſm than Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: and therefore as their Infants were commanded to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; So ours are commanded to be baptiſed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their iuoability and incapacity of doing ſuch acts, or having ſuch Graces, which is equal and alike in both.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In ſuch Conjunctions, if the Texts ſpeak of Actual Faith &amp; Actual indeavoring after Mortification, &amp;c. And require theſe in perſons baptiſed, they muſt be limited to ſuch as were Adults, grown in years, converts from Heatheniſm, ſuch as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the Eunuch; for therefore doth the Scripture name them, to ſhew the ſame, when it mentioneth their Baptiſm, and the conjoyned duties as required in ſuch; which is nothing againſt Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Or if Infants ſhould be meant, it ſufficeth, that theſe have them; Mortification, &amp;c. not in the Act, exerciſing and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting themſelves in any deed, or word profeſſing the ſame, but onely in Habit included and lying in the principle of Grace, the Holy Spirit: and why, becauſe infants are ſinners, not by any proper Act of their own, but onely by an Hereditary Habit. Now who amongſt you can or will ſay, that infants have not thus the Spirit of God, which bloweth where it liſteth, and hath liſted to blow in ſome of them we know of, and thouſands more, where it liſteth, that we know not of, effecting and producing in them this habitual principle of Grace. Of this ſee more before.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Nor is it neceſſary that Baptiſm, in that very moment it is received, ſhould effect all things it figureth out and doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie: (no more was it, that Circumciſion ſhould do the like)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168478:26"/>but it may fall to working them afterwards, wherein preſent there is an impediment and hindrance, that letteth actual fact, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Repentance, &amp;c. as in infants, the want of reaſon doth: Thoſe Actuals are not for the preſent required in infants to be baptiſed, who yet are required to be in preſent actualy baptiſed, for they are required to be partakers of the death and burial of Chriſt, that is, the merit and power thereof, to the killing and burying of ſin and natural corruption, of which Baptiſm is the ſign and means.</p>
                     <p>More briefly and ſyllogiſtically thus take it, as I recollect it.</p>
                     <p>If Baptiſm do ſucceed, and is ſubſtituted of Chriſt now, inſtead of Circumciſion, in the Church of the Gentiles, then, as infants were commanded to be circumciſed then in the Church of the Jewes, ſo are Infants commanded to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the Church of the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>But the Antecedent is true, being the very matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Text above.</p>
                     <p>Therefore alſo the Conſequent is ſuch; and ſo I have reaſoned Infant-Baptiſm into another Command, before I intended this, as reſerved for the latter argument.</p>
                     <p>But I ſerve too large warrants upon you, Sir, to whom I now return, I have another or two brief ones, yet to ſerve.</p>
                     <p>A ſixt warrant therefore is this Reaſon, If infants of Chriſtian Parents be capable of all the good ends, effects and benefis, that Baptiſm bringeth with it, and worketh or offereth them, then ſurely they are both capable of Baptiſm, and their Baptiſm is warrantable and juſtificable. This warrant may be reaſoned out of the Word, or this reaſon warranted out of the Word, 1 <hi>Gor.</hi> 4.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1. The Apoſtle warrants and reaſons his Apoſtleſhip and the Goſpel he preached, to be true and right, from the good ends, effects and benefits that came thereby to the <hi>Gorinthians,</hi> and they received, <hi>That he had begotten them through his Goſpel, they were his work in the Lord, and the Seal of his Apoſtleſhip, were they in the Lord.</hi> So may I hence warrant and juſtifie our miniſtery, and even the Baptiſm which we miniſter, to the infants of Chriſtian Parents, to be good had true, from the many good ends effects and benefits thereof, of which Infants are capable and receptive, and which are wrought and ſealed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168478:27"/>in them thereby: Our Miniſtery of the Seal of Baptiſm, with ſuch effects and ſucceſſe, may be alſo the Seal of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
                     <p>Now the ends, effects, and benefits of Baptiſm are theſe, for which it was appointed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To be a means of entrance and admiſſion into the viſible Church, and a kind of engrafting the party baptiſed into the body of Chriſt, and an enrolling of him amongſt the houſhold of God, as Members and Servants of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To be, inſtead of Circumciſion, an annexed Seal and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yea conveiance of the good and grace of Chriſts word and promiſe covenanted, the ſum whereof is this, of being the Parents God, and God of their ſeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To be a repreſentation and Collation of the waſhing and clenſing of the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, and of the Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and New Birth, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.21.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To be a Tye or Obligation of the baptiſed to ſtricter O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of God and his Truth, to make the parties more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to ſerve God, and careful to abandon ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. to the 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To be a means of Union with Chriſt, and of Unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, knitting them faſter, and bringing them nearer unto Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

                     <p>Now Sir, tell me, which of all theſe our infants are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, that you ſhould thereupon deny them Baptiſm; in the mean time, I tell you, they are capable to them all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not to be denyed. The promiſes of the Covenant, the waſhing away of ſin by Chriſts Blood and Spirit, the admittance into the body of Chriſt, &amp;c. may be ſealed unto them, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are but Paſſive; and if you ſay, ſo are they capable of the Graces, ſigned in the Lords Supper, and therefore may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, I ſay, how know you that? you have no rule for that, no glimpſe of light from the Word for that, whereas I have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:168478:27"/>given you evidence enough of light for the other, if you will ſee there is a Scriptural light, that infants are capable of the Graces ſigned and ſealed in Baptiſm, we may be ſure of it, and therefore may admit them to Baptiſm; there is but your ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal light (which is below Traditional, you ſo much write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt) that they are capable of the Grace ſigned and ſealed in the Lords Supper; are you ſure of it, and will you thereupon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them thereto?</p>
                     <p>The Lords Supper is no initial Seal, and for Reception into Covenant, which I onely plead for, for infants, yet this Seal which is Baptiſm it ſervesto confirm all the benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as the baptiſed grow capable of them, and are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them, and ſo is a good preparative, unto the Chriſtians Paſſeover, or the Lords Supper afterwards, in due time and order; The Lords Supper is a Seal of Augmentation, appointed for the nouriſhment and growth of thoſe Graces which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant promiſeth, and requireth particularly and expreſly of all partakers of it, That they muſt diſcern the Lords Body, and try and examin themſelves, and therefore Infants are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Graces of the Lords Supper, like as they are of them of Baptiſm, for that they muſt be Active in that, whereas they may be but Paſſive in this.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that are capable of all the good ends, effects, &amp; benefits, of an Ordinance, they are not to be forbidden to come, or to be kept back from it, as being a good and valid Ordiance to ſuch.</p>
                     <p>But Infants and little Children are capable of all the good ends, effects, and benefits of the Ordinance of Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Infants and little Children are not to be forbidden to come, or to be kept back from it, it being a good and valid Baptiſm, and beneficial to them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt propoſition is clear, from the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1. already cited, to which I add, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.14 which clears it as to this particular.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond propoſition is not queſtionalbe, that they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as having reaſonable ſouls, belonging (it may be) to election; and ſo having the Spirit, and Grace (as before) and the Letter of the Text ſheweth it, For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, &amp;c.

                     <p>To ſhut up this reaſon, the ſum and reſult is this; That Infants of baptiſed parents, are in capacity to partake of the ends, effects, and benefits of Baptiſm, and of the inward Graces of the ſame, and many of them are actually and really partakers of them (as well as grown perſons, who are viſible profeſſors) and there being in us no infallible ground of certainty, but of Charity, that either the one or the other have thoſe inward Graces, yet they may be accordingly baptiſed; And the viſible right to the Covenant, and the many promiſes made to the ſeed of the faithfu, added to their Capability of the Graces of it, are as good evidences to ground a baptiſm of Infants, as the external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of grown men can give, yea, and to ground a judgement of their partaking of the inviſible Graces, like as the others.</p>
                     <p>And Experience hath, and doth ſhew it, that of thoſe that have been baptiſed in their infancy (our Miniſtry of the Word, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards following upon our Miniſtry of Baptiſm, ſweetly winning upon them, and drawing them, to grow in Grace, and to bring forth other fruits and duties of the Covenant, to which they were bound by Baptiſm, as the Jewes were by their Circumciſion, to be obedience of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3.) there have been; as humble and meek, as mortified and ſanctified Chriſtians, both Men and Women, as any amongſt you, (to ſay no more, not to ſay, more) ſound in the faith, ſorrowful for ſin, zealous in love, fervent in prayer, religious in their houſes, and devout in the houſe of God, ſincere in their dealings, grave in their behaviour, modeſt in their attire, exemplary in their lives, mourniful in Spirit and vexed in Soul, for to ſee the unclean converſations, and the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous courſes of others, as well as you, nay far better than any of you, in many of theſe are, or do.</p>
                     <p>Now though it be ſo, that God ſometimes doth bring good out of evil, as light out of darkneſſe at firſt, yet uſually and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily God doth it not, and therefore in a viſible conſtituted Church, (where he proceeds ordinarily) he doth not from a falſe Miniſtery and an unlawful Baptiſm, produce ſuch good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and lightful converſes. (I do not mean your new light, ſo full of darkneſſe) the which let it be, to the ſtopping of the mouths of all gainſayers, with whom nothing is more rife and frequent, than to revile our Miniſtery and Baptiſm, as falſe and Antichriſtian, evil and unlawful.</p>

                     <p>A word more, from hence, to you Parents; That, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the above-named, good ends, effects and benefits, and now know your Children capable of them, and deſire indeed, they ſhould be partakers of them, bring them to Baptiſm, a means to thoſe ends, a work to that effect, an office to ſuch a benefit. (So whom God deſtinates to an end, he deſtinates to the means, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Why then do you with-hold them from Baptiſm? are you not deſirous, they ſhould, as members of the viſible Church, have a place in the Communion of Saints, and a ſhare in thoſe prayers that are put up to the throne of Grace, for the welfare of the Church, and (particularly) for a bleſſing upon the Ordinances thereof? and that they ſhould have a Seal to plead, not only in the perſent day of their initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but throughout all their life time, as to the Covenant, for all thoſe good things whereof it is a Seal, ſo to the Condition, for fulfilling the good duties, and ſo gaining the anſwer of a good Conſcience, and in which caſe it is ſaid, to ſave?

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168478:29"/>own houſe and kindred, he hath denyed the faith and is worſe than an infidel: but if you provide not for your own Fleſh, and Children, and their Spirits: (not only giving them bedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proviſion, but not giving them alſo ſuch proviſions as God hath made ready for their Souls) you leave them as bad as infidels in a manner unbaptiſed, denying them a means of faith, and the Seal of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>I ſay no more, but what Man is there of you, whom <hi>if his Son ask Bread, will be give him a Stone, or if he ask a Fiſh, will be give him a Serpent,</hi> as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 147.9. <hi>The young Ravens cry to God for their food</hi> to be given them, So your young infants (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) cry to you, and in their crying and weeping, ſeem to call to you for their Water of Baptiſm, as their milk of the Breſts, to be, the one, the relief unto their Souls againſt original guilt and miſery, as the other againſt natural hunger and infirmity.</p>
                     <p>But if you regard not your Children, do you look to your ſelves and your ends and benefits, and amongſt theſe, your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor firſt? Is it not a great honour to you, to have a Child, counted to ſome great houſe, and of the Houſhould, and under the Protection of ſome Noble-man? and is it not a great deal more honour to have a Child, counted to the Houſe of God, the Church, and of the Family, and under the ſafegard of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? why then, baptiſe your Child. If you ſtand not ſo much upon your Honor, or theirs, yet, I am ſure, you are willing to have comfort of your Child, and good hope (here is not ſubſtance and evidence enough for Faith) of its well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whileſt it liveth ſpiritually, and after death, eternally? the way is, enter him into the Church of God by Baptiſm. So you hope, your Child is preferred and made for ever (as you ſpeak) when once you had gotten him into ſome great Houſe and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family, which are but Cottages to the Church, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Family of God: Whereas if you with-hold him from Baptiſm, you do leave him to have his viſible actual ſtanding &amp; abode in the Houſe of darkneſſe, and continue him in an outward caſe and condition, as an alien from the Covenant, and a ſtranger from the Common wealth of Chriſtians, (what in you lyeth) which muſt needs be both diſhonorble and uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to you the while. True indeed, you may have comfort
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168478:29"/>from the Covenant only, if by ſome invincible, and unvoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble act of Providence intervening, your child be prevented and deprived of the Seal thereof which is Baptiſm, full againſt your will and purpoſe; but if through your default and wilfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of him, and Contempt of this Ordinance, it ſo fall out, that your Child dye unbaptized, He may be ſaved without the Seal of the Covenant, I believe; but I dare not promiſe you herein Salvation, or Comfort, without Repentance of this your fault and ſin againſt God in his Ordinance.</p>
                     <p>And ſo this ſhall be my laſt reaſon to you Parents, for the bringing of your Children to Baptiſm, for that thereby you ſhall not onely get honour to your ſelves (as I ſaid) but give ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, by your ſubmiſſion unto the Seal alſo for them, to God, I ſay, who took order for your Childrens honouring you, yea, honoured you both by entring into Covenant with both, and annexing the Seal of Baptiſm thereto for your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comfort and Confirmation. When our Saviour offered himſelf to be Baptized, <hi>John</hi> forbade him, ſaying, <hi>I have need to be baptiſed of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</hi> but Chriſt took him off, ſaying, <hi>ſuffer it to be ſo now, for thus it becommeth us to fulfill all Righteouſneſs,</hi> Matt. 3.13, 14, 15. as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt thought Chriſt above the Ordinance of Baptiſm, by reaſon of his great perfection (and there be alſo others as ſay, they are above ordinances, in a high conceipt of themſelves:) So ſome of you Anabaptiſts think Infants of Chriſtians, below the ordinance of Baptiſm, by reaſon of their great Imperfections: Me things our Saviour Chriſt in this place anſwereth, and reſuteth both them and you; them by his example, who being the Higheſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet ſtooped down, and condeſcended to the Ordinance of Baptiſm, Therefore none ſure, not the higheſt and perfecteſt amongſt men in the Church upon earth, are above Ordinances; and you by his Doctrine, and Exhortation, ſuffer it to be ſo now for thus it becommeth you to fulfill all Righteouſneſs; a part, and act whereof is, the Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, which Baptiſm is now under the Goſpel, as Circumciſion was under the Law; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. and therefore as the Jewiſh Parents were diligent to fulfill that Righteouſneſs, by putting their Children in Covenant under that Seal of Righteouſneſs, Circumciſion, ſo ought ye Chriſtian Parents to be carefull to fulfill this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſneſs,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:168478:30"/>ouſneſs, and to put your Children in Covenant alſo under this Seal of Righteouſneſs, Baptiſm: Suffer it to be ſo now, ſuffer little Children to come unto Chriſt, and forbid them not, for they have need to come to him, and now in his abſence, to his Miniſters to be Baptized; For thus it becommeth you as them, to fulfill all Righteouſneſs. Make not a Nullity of the Seal of Righteouſneſs, leſt you come at length to make Righteouſneſs it ſelf a Nullity too.</p>
                     <p>and now that I am fallen upon this matter of Righteouſneſs, I ſhall turn to you again Sir, my Quaeriſt, and ask you, if you do not deny Baptiſm to Infants, upon this ground, that you think, the efficacy of Baptiſm is ſeated and founded upon the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Righteouſneſs of a Profeſſour, or Member of the Church, manifeſted in words and deeds, Confeſſion and Converſation? which if you do, (as indeed you do, and all that ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant Baptiſm:) it is a groundleſs ground. For the Text I juſt now cited, ſheweth that it is not ſo grounded, but only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Covenantal Righteouſneſs, and the free grace of God in Chriſt; for ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>He received the ſign of Circumciſion, à Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, which he had being yet uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, that he might be the father of all them that believe, &amp;c. that Righteouſneſs might be imputed unto them alſo:</hi> where you ſee it, or hear it in the very Terms, Righteouſneſs of Faith, not Life or Works, Imputed-Righteouſneſs (not inherent or practiſed, which both <hi>Abraham</hi> had, and his Children muſt have.) Now though our Chriſtian Infants, have no inherent Righteouſneſs, or practical manifeſted unto us by their words or deeds (as you require in thoſe you Baptize; and therefore put off your Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Infants untill years of diſcretion to profeſs true Faith, and years of action to practice good works) yet we preſent and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them in their Infancy by Baptiſm, to Gods mercy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love in Chriſt, their and our Ruighteouſneſs and Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that we know, God hath Righteouſneſs to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, by vertue of his Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>I come to my ſeventh and laſt Warrant, which (I foreſſe) will bring you to no Juſtice, yet I will ſerve this alſo upon you, for though now and then in your letter, you let fall ſuch a word, as Primitive Practice, and the good old way, yet I know, you cannot in your heart abide Antiquity, and the Primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168478:30"/>of the Church of old, for that they are point blank againſt your blank point, of Baptizing onely ſuch believers, as can and do make Profeſſion of their Faith in Chriſt, which is but a novel New Light of thoſe Blazings, Comets, and Meteors, that ſprung out in <hi>Germany</hi> ſome while ago, but yeſterday, in compariſon of the Baptiſin of the Infants of believers, which hath brightly ſhined out throughout all the Churches, in good and full Luſtre Sun-like, untill the Man in the Moon Muncer his Lunaticks, or Moon-Sirs, interpoſed, and made ſome Eclipſe thereof in the Churches: This therefore is my ſixth and laſt Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>If it hath been an ancient practice, and conſtant cuſtom of the Primitive, and the ſucceeding Churches, throughout the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages to Baptize the Children of believing Parents, in their Infancy; then it ought to be ſo ſtill continued, accuſtomed and practiſed: This Warrant may be Reaſoned out of the word, or the Reaſon warranted out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.4.9 where Chriſt in caſe of a point of difference about divorce, himſelf argueth and reaſoneth, from the Ancient times, and the beginning of the Church of God. So out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. <hi>if any man ſeem to be Contentious, we have no ſuch Cuſtom, neither the Churches of God:</hi> Where you and I may ſee, the caſe there and here to be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: The <hi>Corinthians</hi> had got up a faſhion of their mens pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered, &amp; in their long Hair, and their women praying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, &amp; in their ſhorn Hair; you likewiſe have taken up a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, of baptizing onely believers, when grown perſons they make profeſſion, and have ſhut out Infants from their right to the Seal of Baptiſm, being Covenanters with their Parents. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> refuteth that their faſhion by divers arguments drawn from the headſhip of man over the woman, from the diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the head, from the ſhameſulneſs and the uncomelineſs of it, from the Preſence of the Angels, from the light of nature, five good and ſound arguments; and when he perceived for all thoſe, that they were contentious and quarrelſome with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and for their faſhion, He clappeth upon them as his laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, this taken from the Churches of God that have been before us. In like manner I have refelled your Practice by ſundry Warrants and Reaſons rayſed out of the word, from ſuch Infants, ſome of them having the ſpirit and faith in ſome
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168478:31"/>degrees; from their being in the ſame Holy Covenant of Grace with their Parents, from the proportion and ſucceſſion of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm unto Circumciſion; from Baptiſme's being a remedy againſt Original ſin eſpecially; from Infants capableneſs of the ends, effects and benefits of Baptiſm, five good and warrantable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of the word: and ſuppoſing for all this you will not be conquered though overcome, but will ſtill ſtrive and contend, contrary to 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24.</p>
                     <p>Now I urge upon you, in the laſt place, this Reaſon, which is the Cuſtom of the Church, both Modern, (we have ſuch a Cuſtom of Baptizing Infants of Believing Patents, and we have no Cuſtom (approved, or General) of Baptizing onely Grown Believers:) As alſo Ancient, (Neither the Churches of God have had any ſuch.) For ſo though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> argue N ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, onely; the Reaſon is of as much force and weight affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, and the Cuſtom of the Ancient and Modern Church's is good and pleadable, both againſt the New Lights of late ſciſmatical Innovators, as alſo for the old Light of former and preſent Orthodex Profeſſours.</p>
                     <p>As for the Negative, the Not, or No Cuſtom Primitive, and practice Apoſtolieal of Baptizing again at their growth, upon Confeſſion of Faith, ſuch as had been Baptized before in their Infancy, I do reſerve it for at other Place, your Dipping Pond, of which I ſhall ſpeak at laſt: onely here I ſhall bring in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, That the Ancient Prinritive Churchès ſucceeding the Apoſtles (what the Apoſtles themſelve did do and practied ſhall hereafter ſoon follow) did hold and practice the Baptizing of Infants; And though I think, it will but diſturb your Brain, and cauſe you to ſtop your Noſtrils and Mouth, who ſmall no ſweet Savour or Odour of Antiquity, as being one of the New Sent, or unſent rather, yet notwichſtanding I ſhall, and relate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of ſome of the Ancient Apoſtles ſucceeding Paſtors and Fathers of the Church of old; and I will do it, for others ſake, who are Lovers of Antiquity, but I will do it in Engliſh for your ſake (whom I am Inſtructing) who are no lover of Languages, more than you can ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>I know, you will not take this General Cuſtom and Practice of the Church upon my bare word and preſent Aſſertion, nor do I deſire you ſhould; Therefore <hi>Remember the dayes of old, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

                     <p>In a matter of Fact or Practice, one Good and Creditable wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſufficient: and that I am ſure I have Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> I mean not onely for the General Practice of Infant Baptiſm in his dayes, and thoſe preſent tim's wherein he lived; as might eaſily be ſhewed our of his Books of Original Sin, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.

The Cuſtom of the Mother Church in Baptizing little ones</hi> is in no wiſe to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not to be thought needleſs, and were not to be believed, but that it was as Apoſtolicall Tradition. This is a very full and clear evidence, of an Eccleſiaſtical Cuſtom, an Apoſtolical Tradition, (whether written or unwritten, that infringeth it not, according to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſt.</hi> 2.15. <hi>hold the Traditons which ye have been taught, whether by word or Epiſtle;</hi>) not to be deſpiſed, but believed.</p>
                     <p>Nor did <hi>Auguſtine</hi> utter this ſuddenly, but adviſedly, and therefore upon ſecond thoughts, ſaith it over again, and the more Reſolutely; in his 15.

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore doth the ſame Father ſo often and ſo much preſs this Argument, The Churches Practice of Baptizing-Infants up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his followers (who were Contemporary with <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) holding Infants were not taken, or tainted with ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:168478:32"/>Corruption and Sin, by propagation, but only contracted the ſame by Imitation; as in his 150 Epiſtle unto <hi>Sixtus;</hi> in his ſecond Book of Marriage and Concup. 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Creſcon.</hi> the Grammarian, <hi>cap</hi> 30. in his fourth Book againſt the Donat. <hi>c.</hi> 23. in his ſixth Book againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> one of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Schollars, or his opinions.</p>
                     <p>Now if this had not been truly and undeniably. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Practice of the Church, even up to the firſt and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affitmed, <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his Diſciples would ſoon have fallen foul upon him, as the Phariſees did upon our Saviour, and have ſaid, <hi>thou beareſt witneſs of thy ſelf,</hi> (&amp; for thy ſelf) <hi>thy witneſs is not true,</hi> they would have given a check or denyal, to ſuch a Cuſtom, accuſed it of Novelty, or but of Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and ſo have turned off eaſily that Argument (which of all other lay moſt heavily upon them) the Ancient Churches Cuſtom and Practice in Baptizing Infants. But they never did that, as who could not deny this.</p>
                     <p>And ſo that other exception againſt <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as if he ſhould utter and urge this in Heat and Paſſion againſt <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary in point of Baptizing of Infants, and ſpeak more of the Cuſtom and Practice of the Church, than was true, falleth of it ſelf. For they differed not in that point of Infant-Baptiſm: no nor in the matter of the Cuſtom of the Church herein. For ſo <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirmeth both in his firſt Book of the Merit and Remiſſion of Sin. <hi>The Peloagians themſelves do grant, that little Children are to be Baptized, as who cannot come in</hi> (or ſtand up) <hi>againſt the Authority of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, delivered without doubt</hi> (or Traditioned) <hi>by our Lord and his Apoſtles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And again in the eleventh Book againſt <hi>Caeleſtius</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> He affirms and cites, that <hi>Caeleſtius</hi> in a Book of his written at <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledged, that Infants in a Book of his wirtten at of ſin, according to <hi>the Rule of the univerſul Church, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſenſe and meaning of the Goſpel:</hi> and Therefore <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> not daring to deny (though otherwiſe impudent enough) the General Practice of the Ancient Church in Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as who then, and that way, might have ſlipt his neck out of the Collaror Yoke, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> held him to, was feign to ſhiſt off that Fathers Argument as well as he could, but very poorly and pittifully, That the Church Baptized indeed Infants, but
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168478:32"/>not for the waſhing away of original fin (which he denyed in Infants) but for the better bringing them to the Kingdome of Heaven, which Chriſt ſaid, was of ſuch, as theirs.</p>
                     <p>And truly, this makes a great Addition to the Truth of this, The Cuſtom and Practice of the Univerſal Ancient Church in Baptizing lnſants, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> ſo great a Schollar and Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, who had ſeen the Cuſtomas and Practices, the manners and faſthions of the <hi>Affricane</hi> and <hi>Aſiatiqne,</hi> yea and <hi>Europaean</hi> Churches, being alſo himſelf a Brittiſh born, ſhould not, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he could not make any denyal, or take any exception there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as who by his own eyes and experience, ſaw &amp; found it to be moſt true and uniform; and ſo I may ſay, our Baptiſm of Infants, is a true Baptiſm; and the Ancient Churches Practice hereof, is a true Practice, even our enemies themſelves being Judges; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.31.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:168478:36"/>unqueſtioned by them; but God would put words of it it to the mouthes of ſome of them, to be witneſſes unto poſterity, of the Antiquity of Infant-Baptiſm, and the Churches Practice.</p>
                     <p>The like anſwer may be given, why in thoſe two General Councels, the Nicene and the Conſtantinopolitan, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provincial ones, which were before <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> nothing is touched upon in their Canons, about Baptiſm of Infants (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his 66 Colleagues before mentioned) becauſe it was at a thing never in queſtion amongſt them, never oppoſed by any; and yet that was a very ſruitful age of haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal weeds ſpringing up, in thoſe purer times; witneſs the <hi>Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, Arrians, Donatiſts Macedonians, Aaerians, Eunomians Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferians, &amp;c.</hi> amongſt all which, not an Antipaedobaptiſt, not any that ſo much as made ſcruple at it, which ſure ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in malice or envy to the Church, would have done, if they could have found, how to have ſhaken that, as they did all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundations of Chriſtinaity.</p>

                     <p>Seeing then you care not for looking behind you to Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, look before you, and ſee the Reformed Churches, in <hi>France, Dutchland, Scotland</hi> (why not <hi>England?</hi> if Infant-Baptiſm be not now in preſent the practice and Cuſtom (and ſo hath been of old, of theſe and other Reformed Churches, what then is your Church (if you have any) but a deformed one, but a New upſtart one, who oppoſe this ſo General Cuſtom both Ancient and Modern, and have quite caſt it out of your doors, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, inſtead thereof, and ſetting up, the Man-Baptiſm, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Rebaptiſm, crying out daily for theſe your Great (little Nothings <hi>Diana's</hi> of the <hi>Epheſian,</hi> firſt love and firſt Baptiſm for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking Anabaptiſts.</p>
                     <p>Let the adviſe you to lay your hand upon your mouth, and ceaſe declaiming and clamouring againſt this infant-Baptiſm, (for therein you reproach God and his Church, God for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, Infant-Circumciſion, and his Church, for uſing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm:) yea to lay your hand upon your heart, and in love to the Truth, to return unto your Firſt Love, and Truth, to enter again into Communion, and fellowſhip with your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church of <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe other her Siſter-Churches of the Proteſtants, giving unto us the Right of Fellowſhip, who are ready to reach forth the ſame to you, and alſo to embrace you.</p>
                     <p>And if this be any Blook you ſtumble at in the way to our Churches, that there are Rents and Diviſions ſtill amongſt us, (whom may we thank for them? even about this infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; I anſwer you in a word, that our differences are not about Baptizing Infants, but about Infants to be Baptized, and ſo, in the Point of Paedobaptiſm, or Infant-Baptiſm, we are all agreed, and agrieved only at your Schiſm and Diviſion, which you have made in our Churches, which are all againſt you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our care muſt be, if we cannot hold fellowſhip with you, to keep our Communion notwiſtſtanding with all Chriſtian Churches; and if you will ſeparate and depart, from us and them, we muſt let you depart, a Brother, or a Siſter is not under Boadage in ſuch Caſes, But God hath called us to peace, peace, as Chriſts Legacy left to his Church, we are willing to have with all man, ſo we may withall retain Truth. And ſeeing whil'ſt we ſpeak of peace, you are ſtill for diſſention, whil'ſt we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168478:37"/>propound truth, you will ſtill hold errors, our care muſt be, (and ſhall be, I hope, in our particulars) to maintain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our peace and Truth, and our Communion in both, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the Reformed Churches abroad, in this point of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which Churches, (as ours at home) God hath bleſſed in this way, with great increaſe of heavenly gifts, and infinite numbers of renouned profeſſours, and Saints of thoſe that have bin baptized in their Infancy, <hi>And that knowing the time that now it is high time for you to awake out of ſleep,</hi> Ro. 13.11. &amp; to repent of thoſe ſinful Sciſmes, and Rents, and Separations you have made between your ſelves and us, and other true Churches, to give over your charging us, and them with iniquity, wherein we ſhew piety, and your putting a divine reſtraint upon Infant, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, wherein God hath given them, and us liberty, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Chriſtian poor Infants, thoſe privileges, and helps to heaven which Chriſt hath indulged them.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have anſwered your laſt Quaere, ſhewing unto you, what warrants we have out of the word, for our Baptizing of Infants, namely the ſix warrants reaſoned out of the word, which are ſix Reaſons, warranted out of the word. Now joyn all theſe reaſons together, with the Scripture out of which they are deduced, and will they not make that Analogy, or proi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Faith, as to this point of Infant Baptiſm, according to which we are to proceed; nay, may they not all ariſe to a Tantamount Command, or a virtual or implicite Command, or a conſequential Command of the ſame, yea I have made two or three of them to be ſuch in their particulars, I have been ſo uſed to give you Commands out of the word, for our former practices, being called ever upon by you, for ſuch Commands, which ſo ring ſtill in my ears, that, though, the word, warrant, do not put me upon ſuch a hot ſervice as a Command: (which I believe notwithſtanding you meant, your Tongue either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running, or ſhort-running your wit,) I ſhall interpret your challenge, or Quaere to aim at, what Command out of the word have you for Baptizing Infants? And firſt, what Command have you out of the word, againſt Baptizing Infants of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Parents, if none, Then you deny Baptiſm to thoſe, to whom Chriſt denyed it not, and ſo, in a manner you deny Chriſt, to be your Maſter, and if you deny him, you deny alſo him that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:168478:37"/>ſent him; if none, then you have no authority to infring or Counter-command the liberty of the Church herein: ye take too much upon you Sone of Muncer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What Command would you have out of the word for our Baptiſing Infants of Baptiſed Parents? do you mean an expreſſ: and praticular Command? in calling for this, you grant an explicite Command for it and a general one; I am glad of this, and will make much of it, as to my purpoſes: for as general propoſitions are enough to infer their particular, all Children of the Church and in Covenant, are to be baptiſed, and therefore the Infants of Baptiſed Parents are to be baptiſed: So implicite Commands, which are but folded up and wrapped in good reaſons or good conſequences, are ſufficient for all true Subjects and Diſciples of Chriſt, to do a work, and this, of Baptiſing the infants of baptiſed Parents, as if it had been more expreſſed; The words intimation, or a deduction from the Word, is to me and ought to be to you, the Words, Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an injunction from the Word. For if you be ſo ſtreit girdled, and queaſie-ſtomacht, or narrow throated, that nothing will down with you, or can be digeſted, but onely expreſſe Commands, in ſo many Words, Letters, and Syllables, as Infant-baptiſm doth conſiſt of, Then I pray, produce ſuch an expreſſe Command out of the Word, for Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, when they are grown, to be inſtructed and baptiſed upon the Confeſſion of Faith, or for Baptiſm of Believers onely, in Chriſtian Churches (to uſe your own words)? or for Woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens eating the Paſſeover, and receiving the Lords Supper, or, for the firſt day of the week to be the Chriſtian Sabbath, or for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other ſuch things that I name not.</p>
                     <p>And yet I have ſomething more to ſhew you, than a Rational and Conſequential Command for Infant-Baptiſm, There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an Analogical (I had almoſt added, Typical) Command for the ſame, our Infant Baptiſm, For Go a Command to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and the Jewes to circumciſe their Infants (the Seal then in force, and for that time of the Law) The ſame Command binds us Chriſtians, to baptiſe our Infants, (the Seal now in force, and for this time of the Goſpel) binds us I ſay by the juſt Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Proportion, that is between the two Sacraments and Seals of one and the ſame Covenant, eſpecially, the one, Baptiſm,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168478:38"/>ſucceeding the other, Circumciſion. Suppoſe a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> (who is of late in many poynts Anabaptiſed, like as you Anabaptiſ are in as many Jeſuited) ſhould oppoſe you, and deny your Baptiſm of Beleevers onely, to be a Seal (as indeed he doth ſo, denies both your and our Baptiſmes and the Lords Supper, to be Seals or Signes) will you not look back to Circumciſion in the Old Teſtament, where it is called a Seal and Sign (for in the New Teſtament they are no where called, either) and thence fetch an Analogical proof, that ours are alſo Seals, our Baptiſm ard their Circumcifion agreeing in the General-Nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By the like Analogy, being queſtioned by you for a Command of Infant Baptiſm in the New Teſtament, if there be none there, I may go over to the Command of Infant Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the Old Teſtament, and thence prove ours, alſo our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm to be commanded, and us therein bound and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to put the Initial Seal of the New Teſtament upon our Children.</p>
                     <p>Once more, Do you think that Gods Command to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Jewes to train up their Children in manner of worſhip which was then in force: doth alſo command and bind us Chriſtians to train up our Children in conformity to ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as are now in force: I beleeve you think ſo; and therefore I think you will beleeve at laſt, that Gods Command to <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Jewes to Circumciſe their Children, and to give them the Seal of Circumciſion, then in force, is alſo a Command upon us Chriſtians, binding us to baptize our Infants, and to miniſter unto them, the Seal of Baptiſm now in ſorce.</p>
                     <p>And ſo now this is the uſe I told you beſore I was like to make of your anſwering, That the Jewiſh Children were circumciſed, onely by vertue of a particular Commandent of God for the ſame, I ſay this uſe I may, and ſhall make of it, that by Vertue or Vice of ſuch you anſwer, I infer alſo there from, yea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, a particular Command for baptiſing Chriſtians Children, there being ſuch an Analogy and proportion between the two Sacraments of one and the ſame Covenant, in the Eſſentials, of it, and the Rationals of it unto the eternal good of Souls. This might be good enough againſt you, becauſe it anſwers you in your kind, and meets with you in your own way, howſoever
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168478:38"/>my ſelf ſtill hold, that the Jewiſh Infants were circumciſed, Circumciſion being the Seal thereof, and ſo both inforced by a Commandement or Word of Inſtitution, as I have ſaid before. But romember this alſo, that Gods Commandement being out for Circumciſing Infants, whoſe Parents were under the Seal, and no farther, by the ſame reaſons you blame our practice of baptiſing Infants, you blame God for ſuch a Command, which you plead for the Circumciſing Infants: becauſe Infants of Jewes were as much under ſtate of Nature, as Infants of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are, and Infants of Chriſtians are as much under the ſtate of Grace, as the Infants of Jewes. If God were wiſe and good in commanding circumciſing of Infants, then we cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and fooliſh in practiſing Baptiſm of Infants commanded alſo here.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe you New-light men, regard not much the Old Teſtament, for that it holds forth the Old-light of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for circumciſing of Infants, by the which walking, there may be proportioned out, or Analogiſed a command for Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Infants; I will ſet upon a Text or two of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that famous one firſt, wherein you much delighted of old, and from whence you would ſeem to have your New light; it is <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.19, and 20. Methinks I hear you ſaying already with <hi>Nathaniel, Can there come any good thing out of</hi> 2 Nazareth? <hi>John</hi> 1.46. &amp; 7. Chap. any command out of theſe words, for Infant Baptiſms, <hi>Come and ſee,</hi> and hear, and whileſt I am as <hi>Philip,</hi> bringing forth ſome good thing hence for poor Infanrs, be you as <hi>Nathaniel, An Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile,</hi> and not an <hi>Iſhmaelite</hi> indeed, in whom there is nought but mocking at young <hi>Iſaacks</hi> devotions, and young Childrens Baptiſms, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I may ſafely ſay, here in this command of Chriſt, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing meant or minded by him, about your taking Children of Beleevers already baptiſed in our Church, where the Goſpel is planted, and your rebaptiſing them again after your teaching them and their profeſſing: For the Baptiſm here commanded and to be executed, was onely of Nations, where the Goſpel was not yet planted, to be taught and bapriſed once.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I may as ſafely ſay, That the ſtate of thoſe Pagan Gentiles, being not the ſame in poynt of Religion, as is the ſtate of us
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168478:39"/>Chriſtian Gentiles, (as is ſaid above) how can their, as yet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught and ungoſpeliſed, their uncovenanted &amp; unbaptiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and be a rule and precedent to a Taught, Guſpeliſed, Covenanted baptiſed Nation already? So Chriſts command here, doth not infringe or counter command our Infant-Baptiſm, yes you may ſay, for doth not Chriſt command all Nations to be taught before they be baptiſed? He doth ſo, all pagan Nations, who <hi>were without Chriſt, being aliens from the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſtrangers from the Covenant of promiſe,</hi> Ep. 2.12. <hi>Without God in the world, being carried away to dnmb Idols,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. What is this to us? but yet,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I muſt tell you; That this Commandement of Chriſt, placing teaching before baptiſing, doth not pronounce Chriſtian Infants, unbaptiſealbe, becauſe unteachable: if there be any ſuch force of Argument from the order and placing of words, I pray argue ſo out of <hi>Mark</hi> 1.1. Where Repentance is placed before faith; and out of <hi>John</hi> 3.5. Where the Water is ſet before the Spirit: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> will tell you, that the Spirit goeth before the Water, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. and you can tell your ſelf, that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance followeth after Faith, as the fruit thereof; again it is not to be read here, firſt teach, then baptiſe. Chriſt doth not ſhew here, which ought to go firſt, and which laſt, but leaves both to be done according to the condition of the Church; for if it ba a Church planted, and Chriſtian, as ours it, then they are to be baptiſed, and after inſtructed: if a Church to be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; Heatheniſh, then they are to be firſt taught, &amp; then baptiſed.</p>
                     <p>Now the condition of the Church of God, which the family of Chriſt chiefly was in the Apoſtles times, at the beginning of their preaching the Goſpel to and throughout the world, was much after the manner, of the Family of <hi>Abraham</hi> (which was then the onely Church repreſentative:) As therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> in his family, had both adult, and Infants, himſelf being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed at 100. years old, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> at 14. years, the Proſelytes at other ſeveral ages, <hi>Iſaac</hi> at 8. dayes, and ſo taught <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and the Proſelytes of his houſe of this covenant and the Sacrament thereof, before he circumciſed them, but forthwith baptiſed <hi>Iſaac</hi> before &amp; without any foregoing inſtruction: juſt ſo doth our Saviour Chriſt appoint to be done in his family the Church, which was now to be raiſed in the greater part, and gathered
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168478:39"/>out of the Nations; So as the adult Heathens, aliens from the Covenant, void knowledge, were firſt to be taught before they were baptiſed, but the Children of ſuch taught and baptiſed Heathens, were forthwith to be initiated by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, before they were taught in the heads of Religion Now the condition of our Churches, is a conſtituted and planted Church, already formed, and therefore according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of this Text, the baptiſing of Infants is to precede, and the teaching them to follow, when by reaſon of years and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, they can hear the word.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chriſt indeed gave Command, that whom his Diſciples had taught, they ſhould be baptiſed; but that none ſhould be baptiſed but ſuchf as were firſt taught, that is your Addition or Tradition, wherein you reſemble the old Separates of the Jewes, the Phariſees (as I have told you, the name of a Phariſee, is in Engliſh a Separate) For as they tranſgreſſed the Commandements of God, by their Traditions of the Elders, <hi>Matthew</hi> 15. So do you corrupt this Commandement of Chriſt, by your Additions, and the inventions of your Youngſters. But in vain did they worſhip God; Teaching for doctrines, the Commandements of men; and in vain do you worry us, bringing in for proofes, the gloſſes and expoſitions of Children.</p>
                     <p>But look again upon the Text in <hi>Matthew,</hi> and ſee, if Teaching do not alſo follow cloſe after Baptiſing, and Baptiſing ſo goeth before Teaching; thus with your own Argument retorted, I have ſlain you, as <hi>Goliah</hi> with his own Sword.</p>
                     <p>But, ſure, our Saviour Chriſt, being the God of Order, and the Wiſdom of God, did not thus place the words, and order them up and down, to no purpoſe. Yea, I conceive, that in ſo doing, he purpoſed to give a full and univerſal Precept or Command for Baptiſm, both to the Apoſtles and others, the Paſtors of the Church, unto the worlds end, that ſo, when they ceaſed, committing their converted Churches unto theſe, ſucceeding them, theſe might proceed, where they left to build, upon their foundations, To Baptiſe and Teach where they had taught and Baptiſed: And thus the words are very orderly placed and ranked, the firſt file (as I may ſo ſpeak) being, of Teaching and Baptiſing where the Apoſtles w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>The next file, or order, is, of Baptiſing and Teaching, where went, either they alſo, as Paſtors in Ordinary, or other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſtors, Baptiſing the Children and Infants of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, Nations and Pagans, being in Covenant with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and teaching them afterwards to obſerve, whatſoever Chriſt commanded, &amp;c. So that here ſeemes to be Chriſts Commandement in this Text, both for Adult-Baptiſm, and alſo Infant-Baptiſm, or (if you will) for Parental-Baptiſm, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their being taught the Covenant and their embracing and profeſſing Chriſt, and alſo for Filial Baptiſm, upon their being in Covenant, as being Children of baptiſed Profeſſors, after which is to follow teaching and inſtructing of them, as they are able: which is punctually obſerved by us, who do, or ſhould, having baptiſed them (by order) Catechiſe them afterwards, that ſo they may be fitted in due time for that other Sacrament, the Lords Supper, according to that of <hi>Hebrews</hi> 6 2. Where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Baptiſms (The Baptiſms I mentioned which are plural or Two, in reſpect of the ſubjects capable, the grown men of the Nations converted, and their Infants or Children, but yet but one and the ſame Baptiſm, as formerly I have ſhewed) Baptiſms I ſay, and impoſition of hands, and alludeth to the practice then and ſince in uſe with the Church, That ſuch Children as were baptiſed in their Infancy, ſhould afterwards openly in their own perſons and with their own mouth, own the Covenant, confirm an ratifie the promiſe and condition, make Profeſſion of their Faith, and ſo be, by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Hands, farther confirmed and admitted to the Lords Supper.</p>
                     <p>Now you, Sir, quite contrary to the order of theſe prinicples of the doctrine of Chriſt, as they are called in the 1. verſe of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. You begin at impoſition or laying on of Hands, before Baptiſm, or the laying on of Water, and ſo do but impoſe upon us, as the Children, (Impoſtor-like) requiring firſt Confeſſion of Faith from them, before they have from you Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, as if your Children born Chriſtians, had no more privilege, were in no better condition, than the Pagans and Nations, Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles unto.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:168478:40"/>
                     <p n="5">5. I ſhall tell you, that the word tranſlated, Teach, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (in which lyeth all the force of your arguing againſt Childrens Baptiſm) it ſignifieth (ſee your want of skill in, and your folly in declaming and clamoring againſt Univerſity and human learning in the divine languages, for ſo are the original ones) ſignifieth in the original, not onely to Teach, but to make Diſciples of the Nations, to admit them to be Scholars, to be taught, This is the end wherefore the Apoſtles were ſent out, namely to make Diſciples, and the Actions, whereby they were to attain this end, were Baptiſing and Teaching, and if it were not thus, there would be found a Tautology in Chriſts words, and you muſt read them thus, Go teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, baptiſing them, Teaching them. Such an Expoſition as this would put you to your ſhifts, Go ye, make Diſciples to me out of all Nations by Baptiſing and Teaching; and ſuch a one, may do well enough, very well againſt you, who when you come to this or any Text, do but ſhift up and down for your ſelf, but ſift not at all for the ſenſe. And therefore (to puzzle you a little, for there is no farther hopes of any of you I fear,) I will tell ſomewhat more that our Divines have added to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this Expoſition; Chriſt ſaith not, go make Diſciples and baptiſe them, but make diſciples baptiſing them, implying, that by baptiſing them they made them Diſciples; Like as it is ſaid, that <hi>John</hi> did baptiſe in the Wilderneſſe and preach, as though he did baptiſe firſt, and then preach: So all Iſrael is ſaid to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed into <hi>Moſes,</hi> not as already taught, but to be taught by him, for the future, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2.</p>
                     <p>But I will not ſtand upon this Diſcipling the Nations, by baptiſing them and their Children. Though the word (diſciple them) be a general word, comprehending in it both kinds of converſion, both by the preaching of the word, and the initiation of baptiſm.

In the mouth of two witneſſes this word may ſtand, to bear you down for <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. Children, upon whoſe necks thoſe falſe Teachers would have put the yoak of circumciſion, are called Diſciples, I ſay, they would have put it upon the Infants of beleevers, as well as the beleeving Parents, for they would have done it after the manner of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, preſſing it ſtill to be of force. And why not Diſciples, I pray? do they not viſibly belong to the family and ſchool of Chriſt, yea and his Kingdom, and ſo why not ſubjects alſo? are not the little Children of a kingdom, ſubjects thereof, though they know not the Lawes of the ſame? is not the promiſe made unto our Children, and the Covenant of God upon them, and do not we Parents offer them to God, giving up our Names to God, both for our ſelves and all our Families, and undertake for them, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and education in chriſtianity, and will this work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the declaring them Diſciples? I will ſhut up all theſe interrogatories with this Aſſertory, that becauſe if children of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168478:41"/>Chriſtian diſcipled parents be alſo diſcipled, why then they are within this commandement of Chriſt, and may and ought to be baptized; and ſo you have a commandement for their bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing out of that word, Go diſciple the Nations; our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are as capable of being Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>Or (if you will not go from your Engliſh) of being taught, as the children of the Jewiſh Parents were; which if you yeeld unto, as you cannot do otherwiſe, then ſhew me ſome reaſon why our children are not as capable of Baptiſm without ſuch teaching, as the Jews children were of Circumciſion without the ſame. Beſides that. I will minde you of this, that though they be not capable of receiving actual teaching from men, they are not uncapable of Gods own teaching, even in their infancy, no more than children of the Jews were, that hereupon you ſhould debar ours from Baptiſm, when as theirs were not kept from Circumciſion upon any ſuch account.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The ſame, or rather another, Commandement for our Infant Baptiſm, may be fetched out of thoſe words, <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them,</hi> for whom doth our Saviour deſign here for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Baptiſm, or perſons to be baptized? why, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, or taught Nations, Parents and Children, they have a right to the Goſpel preached, as Nations, but a right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Parents and Children, as diſcipled, taught, and brought into Covenant. So that when Chriſt commanded the Apoſtles to baptize the Nations ſo diſcipled and taught, he did not look onely to the time then being, but to the continuation of a Chriſtian Progeny and Poſterity of Believers upon earth. So that as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1 16. For this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me, firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long ſuffering, for a pattern to them who ſhould hereafter believe on him to life everlaſting: ſo theſe Nations obtained mercy, that in them firſt, Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth Baptiſm, for a pattern to them who ſhould hereafter be diſcipled and taught of him in the everlaſting Covenant; namely, that Baptiſm belongeth to them, all other Nations, ſo far forth as they conſiſt of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Parents and Children, Parents profeſſing Chriſt in their own perſons, and their Children under their Chriſtian Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; both together make up a diſcipled Nation, commanded here to be baptized, as the proper and adaequate Subject of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:168478:42"/>So that if I can ſhew that the Children are contained in the word Nations, the work is done, a commandement here is for their baptizing. I ſhall do it briefly, yea it is done to my hand already.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is a general rule in Scripture, That children are alwaies included in every adminiſtration, whether of promiſes or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, mercies or judgements, privileges or burdens, unleſs they be excepted; and in the very conſtitution of it, children make a great part of a Nation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In this particular, of theſe, all Nations here, ſome think it to be ſpoken emphatically, in oppoſition to the one Nation of the Jews (and ſo it is in a ſenſe, this was the onely taught and diſcipled Nation, but now, go and teach and diſciple all Nations?) I ſhould rather, or as well, think it to be ſpoken in appoſition and relation unto the one Nation of the Jews, that like as the Nation of the Jews hath been a long time diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled and taught in the Covenant, and circumciſed, the parents with their children: ſo now all Nations are commanded to be likewiſe diſcipled and taught in the ſame Covenant, and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, the parents with their children, the which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth clearly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. &amp; 9. namely, that the Doctrine of the Goſpel delivered to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the nature of a Covenant, was preached now to all Nations, and ſo the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family was here conveyed to the believing families of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo the Promiſe and the Seal Baptiſm were here applied to the ſame families, father and children, as the promiſe and ſeal Circumciſion were to the particular families of <hi>Abraham,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and children, and ſo here came the Nations to be bleſſed in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> here began to be the father of many Nations.</p>
                     <p>The which may be yet made more to appear, if the time be looked upon, when the Apoſtles were ſent to teach or diſciple theſe Nations, juſt when Circumciſion lay a dying (as I may ſo ſay) and expiring, or ceaſing to be a ſeal of adminiſtration unto the Jewiſh Church, a very fit time, the very time for the Lord to appoint Baptiſm, and to enlive it for the ſeal, to come in place of the other, and perform the ſame office in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Gentiles, as the other did in the Churches of the Jews, namely, to let in the believing parents with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:168478:42"/>
                     <p>Look again into <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.23. &amp; 24. theſe Gentile and Pagan Nations were to be taken into the place of the Nation of the Jews; now upon this their cutting off and caſting out, and theſe wild olives were to have the ſame engraffing into the good Olive, as the natural branches had: but they and their children were graffed in, and now they and their children are cut off; ſo theſe and their children, of the Nations here, were in the like manner here engraffed and implanted into Chriſt, and therefore baptized, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. like as the other circumciſed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, what a great change would there have been elſe in the heart and love of Chriſt, if now he, who rebuked the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles for hindring the little children of the Jews to come unto him, yea who embraced them in his arms, laid his hands upon them, and bleſſed them, ſhould now himſelf in this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement unto his Apoſtles, to teach, diſciple, and baptize the Nations, not minde them the children of theſe Nations in the like manner as to Baptiſm, as he did the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> as to Circumciſion, but leave them out, or forbid them to come, or be brought unto him, as if he had now no delight, or took no pleaſure in the Infantry of the Gentiles, whereas himſelf long before ſpake of this very time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.22. <hi>Behold, I will lift up my hands to the Gentiles, and ſet up my ſtandard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, and they ſhall bring thy ſons in their arms or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, and thy daughters ſhall be carried upon their ſhoulders.</hi> But why did not Chriſt here put in, baptize the Nations and their ſeed, as he did in the firſt adminiſtration, Circumciſe the Jews and their ſeed? The Anſwer is made in the very Queſtion, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did it in the firſt adminiſtration of Circumciſion, there was no need of doing it again; and beſides, children having once a right to be accounted as belonging to Chriſts Church, and to be reputed viſible Members thereof, and no forfeiture made thereof on their part, or bar put In by Chriſt or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon of authority, they are alwaies ſo to be reckoned of, yea they are here put in again and mentioned, in the diſcipled Nation, and comprehenſively included in Them, baptize them, the Nations diſcipled, which conſiſt of parents and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which make them up.</p>
                     <p>Again, if the children had not been included here, in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what a great change had here bin made in the latitude and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:168478:43"/>extent of the Covenant, as to the ſubject thereof, I mean this particular of children, and that without warning given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome other proviſions or courſe might have been ſought for and ſupplicated at Gods hands, for the good of their ſouls? for by this your rule of ſhutting out children from Baptiſm, by the power of this commandement, according to your interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if a Jew ſhould convert to Chriſt, and become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and believe in Chriſt come in the fleſh, he ſhould be in a worſe condition as to his child than before, as who may not be baptized, whereas before he might be circumciſed, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faith in Chriſt will be a loſs and prejudice to his child; and both parent and child may think it to be a worſe Covenant than the former, whereas it is but one and the ſame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he was a Jew, his child was circumciſed, ſo when he becomes a Chriſtian, his child is to be baptized.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have, out of this Text of <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.19. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your party glorieth ſo much, (though I forgate to tell you, that herein is not deſcribed the primary Inſtitution of Baptiſm, but onely an enlargement of the Apoſtles Commiſſion) I have evinced a commandement for baptizing of Infants of Believers: you (perhaps) looked for a command, expreſt in ſo many let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſyllables, Go, baptize the children of Believers; but is it not good and effectual (it ought to be) if included in the ſenſe and meaning of the words? are not Magiſtrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters too (by your leave) meant in that commandement, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy Father? are not envie and hatred likewiſe compriſed in that command, Thou ſhalt do no murder? yet neither thoſe nor theſe are expreſly literally or verbally commanded; where is the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Revelations?</hi> yet he meant, and his univerſal headſhip, by the Beaſt there and his mark. I could give you many more inſtances. And why not Infants alſo compriſed in this command, Diſciple the Nations and baptize them, though not ſet down there by name, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Nations and Diſciples to be baptized. But I have writ enough of this Point before.</p>
                     <p>I will onely (as formerly, now alſo for a concluſion of this Point,) leave with you another Syllogiſm, ſuppoſing that now, having been uſed to them, (Syllogiſms I mean) you will not be much afraid of them, though you think them the bug bears
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168478:43"/>of the Univerſities, and limbs of humane Arts and Sciences: fear not, for unleſs you come nigh them, which (I believe) you will not, or dare not, they will not bite you: otherwiſe, they have teeth in their mouths.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth Syllogiſm is this:</p>
                     <p>The diſcipled or taught Nations, and ſo brought into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are commanded by Chriſt to be baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.</p>
                     <p>But the Parents and their children are the diſcipled or taught Nations, and ſo brought into Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Parents and their children are commanded to be baptized.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Propoſition is the letter of the Text, as is ſaid.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is largely proved before, and who need doubt but that children are included in the word Nations? being a part, and a great part of them, and comprehended in every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of grace and mercy eſpecially.</p>
                     <p>And now leaving the commandement of Chriſt for Infant Baptiſm, I proceed to the ſecond kinde of Warrants you call for; namely, the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for ſo theſe two you yoke together in your Quaeres, and impoſe upon my neck to bear up and carry out in this and all points, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Examples, when your ſelf, as a Bullock unaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the yoke, neither do, nor can ſhew either of the two, for your wild, untamed, and untaught opinion.</p>
                     <p>As for the example of Chriſt, it is a vain thing to demand it, as who baptized none, as I have told you formerly out of the Evangeliſt.</p>
                     <p>And for the Apoſtles, they baptized but a few, as whoſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and work was eſpecially, and lay for planting Churches, and raiſing of foundations out of grown perſons converted by them out of Judaiſm and Gentiliſm, as is expreſly ſet down, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13 &amp; 17. And therefore if Chriſt ſent them not to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but to preach the Goſpel, (not to baptize, either eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in reference to preaching and converting, or generally, all whom they preached unto or converted:) it was not part of their commiſſion to do ſo, nor any violation of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for them not to do ſo; for then S. <hi>Paul</hi> would, and ſhould rather have asked God pardon, than given him thanks, as here he doth, for that he baptiſed none of the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:168478:44"/>(whom notwithſtanding <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus he begate through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15.) ſave ſome few here alſo named and mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him.</p>
                     <p>This I acquaint you with at firſt, to let you underſtand the reaſon of ſo frequent mention of the Baptiſm of believing Converts, and of ſo much ſilence in Scripture of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and to ſhew you further the irrationality of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, who, as your friends and father Jeſuites were wont to call upon us, for Names, Names of Proteſtants before <hi>Luther</hi>'s daies, now clamour me for Examples, Examples of baptized In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the Apoſtles time: Yea, to preſent to you the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of your reaſon, ſo frequently urged, the Apoſtles did not practiſe conſtantly the baptizing Infants, and therefore it is not to be ſo done. For (beſides, that for you to reaſon negatively from the Scripture in a matter of fact, as here from the not-pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles, to the unlawfulneſs of our practice, and fact, ſheweth you are indeed averſe, not onely to humane, but even Divine Arts and Sciences, there being no Divinity, little humanity, in ſuch arguments, fitter for children than men, for the ſcales of a Higler, than the Schools of a Diſputer.) I have ſhewed you good reaſon why the Apoſtles (yea the Apoſtles own reaſon, which (I ſuppoſe) you will not deny to be good) did not baptize all, either grown perſons whom they convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or their Infants by name, and ſometimes did not baptize at all, when they had converted people. And may not I now turn the ſame Argument upon and againſt your ſelf, and put the ſame yoke upon your neck? There is no practice of any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to be ſeen or read of in the whole Goſpel, or Acts of the Apoſtles, of their baptizing any Chriſtians child, when he was grown up to years, and therefore your practice in doing ſo is unlawfull and unwarrantable, you (I believe) would think this but mad arguing, but <hi>you know the man and his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.11.</p>
                     <p>From the Acts of the Apoſtles there may be, but from the non-Acts of the Apoſtles there may not be made or drawn a good reaſon to enforce or unforce a practice. There is recorded no practice of any Apoſtle, admitting women to the Lords Supper, or example of any woman receiving the Lords Supper (more then of Infants receiving Baptiſm, and the Apoſtles
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:168478:44"/>admitting them thereto) will you therefore hence conclude, the practiſe of Womens receiving the Lords ſupper is to be omitted? yes will ſay there is, for doth not Chriſt ſay; <hi>Drink ye all of this;</hi> And I ſay, Chriſt alſo ſaid, <hi>Teach baptiſe all Nations;</hi> (therfore Infants) will as well follow here; As therefore women will follow, there you will ſay again, was not the Lords ſupper, adminiſtred, to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and therfore to the Women therein? and ſo (ſay I) was not Baptiſm adminiſtred to the whole Church of <hi>Corinths,</hi> and to whole families there, and therefore to the children therein? You will ſay again, that in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus there is neither Male nor Female,</hi> Gal. 3.28. And may not I ſay, that in Chriſt Jeſus there is neither Old, nor Young, Father or Child? Thence indeed you may prove and deduct that Women are not to be kept back from the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but there is nothing expreſly ſet down or mentioned of their receiving the Lords ſupper, or the Apoſtles giving them it. And ſo may I prove hence (and have proved many wayes) that Chriſtian-Infants are not to be kept back from the Lords Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Though there ſhould be nothing mentioned explicitly of the Apoſtles practiſe of baptiſing children, or childrens exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of receiving baptiſm, in the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>For your fuller Underſtanding in this poynt, look back to what I have diſcourſed formerly about our imtation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of th Apoſtles and their practiſes; To which I add, that their practiſe and example is and ought to be, in all Morall and material acts of Religion, an affirmative and Poſitive Rule to the Churches of God, as thus and herein, they baptiſed ſuch, and ſuch, and therefore we may do the like. But it is no nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or excluſive rule. They baptiſed not ſuch and ſuch. That therefore we may not baptiſe ſuch, for the reaſon is plain, that they poſſibly might not meet with all perſons and occaſions, and their practiſe is not a full rule, though a good rule; but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I gave before, is a playner one, for that they were altogther, in a manner, or chiefly taken up with the preaching to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions converting people and planting Churchs, that they could not, nor did attend ſo much upon Baptiſing, and therefore their Practiſe and example in not baptiſing ſuch or ſuch, is no rule for the Churches to walk by now.</p>
                     <p>But yet (Sir) notwithſtanding all this, there are fair footſteeps
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:168478:45"/>and prints of the Apoſtles feet to be ſeen, walking in this, though not ſo much beaten, way of baptiſing beleevers and their infante, which the ſcriptures have traced and tracked out for us to take after them. As in the Acts of the Apoſtles, chap. 16 15. <hi>Lydia ſhe and her houſhold was baptiſed,</hi> and verſe 33. <hi>The Gaoler, He and all his houſhold was baptiſed;</hi> Acts 18. chapter verſe 8. <hi>Criſpus with all his houſe,</hi> and many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with their houſholds (for ſo it is meant) were baptiſed. So in the Acts of <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4, 5.6. Where is repeated again, the baptiſing of <hi>Criſpus,</hi> and <hi>Gaius, and the houſhold of Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I know nothing to the contrary, or contrary to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and proportion of faith, but rather it may be agreeable to the Harmony of the ſcripture, and theſe ſcriptures, If I ſhould ſay that thoſe perſons who are mentioned but ſingle, are meant to be baptiſed, them, and their houſholds; as <hi>Gaius</hi> here by <hi>Paul.</hi> So <hi>Cornelius</hi> by <hi>Peter,</hi> yea the Eunuch, baptiſed alone by <hi>Philip,</hi> might procure his children, if he had any, to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by ſome or other Evangelical miniſter coming into thoſe coaſts, and ſo where the houſhold of <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> and the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> are mentioned, as <hi>Romans</hi> 16.10. And the houſhold of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.19. Baptiſed houſholds are there meant.</p>
                     <p>Now when it is ſaid, ſuch and ſuch were baptiſed and all their houſholds, ſuch a one, and All his, by the Apoſtles, is your imagination ſo ſtrong, and wide, as to ſhut out the children firſt out of doors of thoſe houſholds, that ſo next you may exclude them, from the Apoſtles Baptiſm? You muſt do ſo, if there were a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny within doors, or tell us, that the Apoſtles paſſed by them, in their baptiſings; or you muſt ſhew us, that all the Women in thoſe houſholds, were barren, not a Mother of a Child, or a young one amongſt them all (For though there ſhould not have been in them, Infants or Sucklings, yet, if but a youngling and a Child of ſome years, all would have been but as one, as to their Underſtanding and confeſſing.) Or you muſt thus divide the houſholds, (as you are good at dividing houſes and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, ſetting the Husband againſt the Wife, and alienating the Children from Father &amp; Mother, which is a very bad practice,) and ſay, that not all the Houſhold was baptiſed, whereas the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:168478:45"/>Text ſaith expreſly, He and all his houſhold were baptiſed, but ſome major part, or the moſt conſiderable part of the houſe, and when it is ſaid, the houſe of Iſrael was circumciſed, its meant not of a part, either major or moſt conſiderable, but of the whole houſe, as to the Parents and Children, and Servants alſo or Proſelytes under their education and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>I do not wonder, you cannot abide our Univerſity, Arts, and Sciences, Theſe cannot abide you and ſuch reaſonings and interpretations; the Apoſtles baptiſed ſuch and all their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, that is, the greater part, the people of Growth: for though ſometimes ſuch a word may be ſo taken, where all are not capable of the thing done or ſpoken of, you muſt prove it to be ſo here meant in all the places, where the Apoſtles baptiſed ſuch and all their houſholds, which you can never doe, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ Letter (which you are ſo for,) is expreſly againſt you, ſuch and all their houſholds, of which many times alſo children are not onely ſome of all, and a part of the whole, but (in your Tearms, one of them at leaſt) the major part (I ſay not the moſt conſiderable) but I ſay a capable part too, but if in all or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe houſholds, there was but one infant, or any one young ſtripling, you are gone, as to the Apoſtles practice who baptiſed the beleever, and all his houſhold: and incapacity here is none to hinder either our interpretation or the Apoſtles miniſtration; for if there had been any in the houſhold uncapable, The Apoſtle would not have baptiſed the whole houſhold, or the beleever, and all his houſhold: and I have abundantly ſhewed before from the Apoſtle, that Infants of Beleevers are capable of baptiſm, Verſe 32. Now if be ſaid, that the Apoſtle preached and ſpake the word to the Gaoler, All that were in the Gaolers houſe, ſo all might beleeve and be baptiſed; it is true, the Apoſtle did ſo ſpeak the word to all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, but yet at the 31. Verſe, he ſpeaks of the ſalvation of all the houſe upon the tearms of the Gaolers beleeving, for that the promiſe and Covenant being ſo made at firſt, held ſtill to beleevers, parents and their children and here alſo ſervants, becauſe it is ſaid, he and all his, were baptiſed in the 33. verſe. So it appears to me, that the Gaoler himſelf onely beleeved, and had an inward work of Faith wrought in the heart upon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:168478:46"/>ſome ſpecial evidence he received of Chriſt come in the fleſh, whereupon he and his, (of whom, the other Pagans of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily there is nothing ſaid as to their faith, whether ſervants of growth or children under age the whole houſhold, were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed immediately, in relation to the Fathers and Maſters, undertaking and engaging for themſelves and their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds.</p>
                     <p>And indeed (to keep to my particular) if ſuch in theſe, or our houſholds, as did, or do actually beleeve and profeſſe, were and are to be baptiſed onely, why was the houſhold, as of the Gaoler before, who onely there beleeved (as I have ſhewed) ſo: the houſhold of <hi>Lydia,</hi> (of whom onely, it is ſaid that the Lord opened her heart to beleeve in Chriſt) baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
                     <p>Surely the Apoſtles would not bring in a different Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, now in the houſholds of beleeving Chriſtians, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Jewes or Pagans, from that which ever was in uſe and practice amongſt the houſholds of beleeving Jewes at firſt, and therefore went here according the common cuſtom former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in time of circumciſion, and where they baptiſed any beleeving Father of a Family, there they did baptiſe, or others for them, the children of the ſame houſhold, or might have done. Otherwiſe, how could they, the Apoſtes when they preached the Goſpel to all Nations and ſo to their houſholds, how could they bring the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> into all Nations and their houſholds (according to the prophecy and promiſe thereof by God) if they did not apply the Covenant and the Seal gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to them and theirs, in the ſame manner as it was to him and his, ſo, that the children of beleevers might now be baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as formerly they were circumciſed?</p>
                     <p>And laſtly I may add this, That when men in thoſe dayes were converted from Judaiſm or Pagainiſm, they did (proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) at their admittance into the Church by baptiſm, make an open and ſolemn League and Covenant with God, before ſome people preſent to profeſſe the Faith of Chriſt, they and their houſholds, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> may ſeem to put ſome of them in mind of, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 6.4. <hi>Fathers bring up your Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord:</hi> And therefore when the Apoſtles did baptiſe houſholds of beleevers, they did it in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:168478:46"/>on to the Parents, or others in their ſtead, undertaking and ingaging for themſelves and the children therein.</p>
                     <p>And thus now at laſt, and at length too (as all other point) I have aſſerted unto you this Point alſo, of Apoſtolical Practice and Examples, for the baptizing of the children and Infants of believing Parents.</p>
                     <p>I have anſwered all your Quaeres, and (I hope) have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and ſetled your judgement better by my anſwers, than you could do it by our Quaeres (for I cannot yet forget, how that at the end of them you ſay, <hi>theſe your Quaeres are your judgement.</hi>) I proceed now to what you have more in your Letter of two ſheets, but do not mean to proceed, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, either to tranſcribe all your words of the ſecond ſheet, all have done your words of the firſt, or to beſtow twenty and five ſheets cloſely written, in anſwering of your ſecond ſheet, but looſely written, as I have done upon your firſt ſheet (for I have diſpatched hitherto but the one firſt ſheet of your Letter) and there is good reaſon for it.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt ſheet, for the moſt part, put Quaeres to me, in your number twenty one, and they contained in them ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and ſubſtantial things to be anſwered, of a large extent, and great depth; and therefore I thought good to give unto them a full and proportionable anſwer, what pains and time ſoever it ſhould coſt me. But that which you propound in your ſecond ſheet to me, is nothing but certain Conſiderations of your own, againſt baptiſm of Infants, and about ſome Texts of Scripture, the very froth and barmings of your own head; the which if I ſhould let alone unreplied to, as once I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, would of themſelves ſink, diſperſe, and fall to nothing. But, loſt you ſhould ſwell and be puffed up in any conceipt of theſe your conſiderations, as the Bladder is with its own winde, I will as briefly as I can, with my ſhort breath, by reaſon of my old age, blow away your froth, and let out your winde, that ſo the hollowneſs and ſhallowneſs of them may appear to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>The Title you ſet over your firſt Conſideration, is this, <hi>More particularly about the Doctrine of Babtiſm</hi> (Baptiſm) <hi>conſider theſe Arguments proved by clear and plain Scripture.</hi> Sir, this is a falſe Title to your Tractate; for if you would have done here more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:168478:47"/>particularly, it ſhould have been, and you ſhould have ſaid, about the Doctrine of Infant-Baptiſm: for if you bring not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, not onely about Baptiſm, as you ſay, but againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm, and theſe proved by clear and plain Scripture, I ſhall not conſider them, neither have you conſidered well of our difference. 1. You bid me <hi>Conſider that the Doctrine of Infants Babtiſm overthrows the nature of the Covenant of grace, and the whoe</hi> (whole) <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> why ſo? <hi>becauſe the Covenant of grace and Goſpel of Chriſt ſtands upon the account of faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in there one</hi> (heir own) <hi>perſons, as uppears in</hi> John 3.36. <hi>and</hi> John 5.24. <hi>But Infants Babtiſm ſtand upon the account of the faith in there (their) Parents or Surtie,</hi> (Sureties,) <hi>(although they have none for themſelves) and ſo makes faith void and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſery</hi> (unneceſſary) <hi>to the perticipation</hi> (participation) <hi>of the Covenant,</hi> Rom. 4.13. Gal. 3.17, 8.</p>
                     <p>But what do I? did I not ſay I would not tranſcribe your words of your ſecond ſheet? but I ſee I muſt do it, for there is ſo much falſe-written Engliſh in them, that I muſt of neceſſity do it, leſt if inſcribed to my Anſwer, that may be thought mine. But to the matter. Baptiſm of Infants of Believers, doth not overthrow, but eſtabliſh the Covenant and Goſpel of Grace, becauſe it ſealeth and executeth it. Neither doth the Covenant of Grace, and the Goſpel, ſtand upon the account of actual Faith in all mens own perſons, but onely ſuch as being grown in years, are converted from Paganiſm, theſe muſt make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, before they can come into the Covenant, and be ſealed. But actual faith is not a Condition required, as to the Covenant or Seal in Infants. Your Text therefore of <hi>John</hi> 3.36. is not to the purpoſe, as which onely ſets everlaſting life upon (to uſe your phraſe) the account of actual faith, which I grant, and ſo doth the next Text, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. as appears, for that he begins with, and ſpeaks of ſuch as do hear the Word of God, and beleeve in Chriſt, which is not appliable to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants but grown men: And as to your Inference, The bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants ſtands upon the account of their being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant together with their Parents, and not upon the account of the Faith in their Parents or Sureties, but only ſo far, as the Faith of the Parents ſerves to ſhew them a ſeed of the faithful; and the Faith of the Sureties, undertakes for their education
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:168478:47"/>in, and profeſſion of Faith afterwards: How ſtrangely alſo do you pervert that Text, <hi>Romans</hi> 4.13? For it is there ſaid, <hi>the promiſe</hi> was made to <hi>Abraham, that he ſhould be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham and his ſeed through the Law, but through the Righteouſneſſe of Faith;</hi> Which he had yet being uncircumciſed, to whom God upon this account of this faith, made the Promiſe both to himſelf and his Seed; you would have the faith there ſpoken of to be the faith of the Seed or Infant, as holding it neceſſary to the participation of the Covenant, and ſo falſifie both Covenant and Text, which both, together with your laſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. do quite overthrow your firſt overthrowing Conſideration (for Argumentation here is none.) More of this you ſhall have hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Your ſecond Conſideration, becauſe it hath a Narration, yea a repetition of what you ſet down in your firſt Page, about the nature of the ſtate (ſo you ſpeak, whereas rather you ſhould ſay, the ſtate of the Nature) of Chriſts true viſible Church under the Goſpel, to the ſhewing of which you here onely deſcribe Chriſts true inviſible Church, and therefore cite the Texts you did before, and add ſome more, that ſpeak onely of inviſible Members, ſuch as you call Saints, made ſo by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Seed, new Creatures by the benefit of Regeneration. I ſhall therefore ſay nothing to that here, but refer you, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Reader, to what I have largely before diſcourſed, about the ſtate and nature (for I will correct my ſelf too) of the Church both viſible and inviſible; for though you may (perhaps) have no ſuch care of me, I muſt and will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that I dead not the Reader, by any tedious and vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions and Tautologies.</p>
                     <p>Yet this I ſay in anſer to it, That Infant-Baptiſm in the Church, is ſo far from overthrowing (as you argue) the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſtate of Chriſts true viſible Church, that it is rather much confirmed and eſtabliſhed, increaſed and enlarged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, becauſe thereby more are admitted in preſent, members vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and are engaged to be for the future, viſible profeſſors and confeſſors of Chriſt; yea, and the inviſible Church alſo is not overthrown, but upheld and augmented by our Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as whereby many Infants are not onely dedicated and conſecrated unto Chriſt, but are alſo by Baptiſm, as a Seal
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:168478:48"/>and Means (as I have ſhewed) regenerated, and ſo fitted and prepared the better for Heaven and happineſs. And whereas you add, <hi>That Infants Baptiſm is grounded upon the Relation they have to the Church, by generation onely, or by the meer pro eſſion of faith and repentance in the Parents and Sureties,</hi> I ſee you are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in your Principles, and grounds of Divinity.</p>
                     <p>Once more I tell you (I pray learn it now, for I will teach you it no more) for the Readers ſake, that Infants Baptiſm is grounded and foundationed upon the Covenant of God made with the believing Parents, for himſelf and Infants, and that which you call Generation, doth but raiſe up the ground and foundation-Covenant to bring it into ſome act of viſibility in relation to the Church, for the Seal thereof. And ſo alſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have not their relation unto the Church by generation (rather by this they have relation to the world) nor by the meer faith and repentance of the Parents and Sureties, but by the Covenant and the Seal thereof, in both which Infants are intereſſed together with their Parents, have they their relation unto the Church. For which you may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39, &amp; 41. (becauſe you give me no Text here, which I wonder at) of which I have your conſideration in particular to peruſe anon.</p>
                     <p>Onely I ſhall add a word or two about Sureties in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants, becauſe I do not remember that hitherto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, you have made any mention of them; and for that I ſee you are here in an errour about them; and you would put a ſlur upon us, and a kinde of ſlander upon our Church, as if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm ſtood upon account of faith in the Parents and Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, although (ſay you;) they have none for themſelves. I will adde ſomewhat, although they have more than your ſelf. I may ſay the one, as well as you ſay the other.</p>
                     <p>Know then Sir, that the coſtom of having Sureties at the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants, hath been very ancient in the Church, when Truth was in its prime light, and Primitive purity, though thereupon it is the leſs liked, becauſe the more unlike to the new upſtart and out-ſtaring noveliſms of theſe later Ages, and laſt declining times; and their office was, as to bear witneſs of the birth of Infants of Chriſtian Parents, and therefore were called Atteſters or Witneſſes (as at this day) ſo to anſwer for the faith, and take upon them the education of the baptized In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:168478:48"/>and for this they were called Sponſors or Suſceptors. Hereupon the Infant to be baptized, although he did not profeſs himſelf to be Believer with his own mouth, nor could, yet being asked and interrogated (as the manner was) Doeſt thou believe? he anſwered in the mouth and tongue of his Sponſors or Sureties, or the very Parents, or they (which is all one) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in ſtead and place of the Infant, I believe. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch profeſſion of faith, Infants publickly were not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Church. Thus in and by the judgment of charity, the Ancients <hi>held and judged</hi> the Infant to believe, and that if it could ſpeak with its mouth, it would anſwer, that it belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and becauſe it could not, they appointed (as before) Sponſors and Sureties in the name and place of the Infant, to anſwer, I believe.</p>
                     <p>And in this ſenſe alſo (beſides others I have given) were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Chriſtians called of old, Believers, becauſe they did in ſome manner profeſs faith, in and by the mouth and words of their Sponſors, Sureties and Parents. True, its uncertain and unknown to the Church, or man, whether the Infant doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or not; but unleſs the Church had ſo judged by the judgement of charity (which, ſaith the Apoſtle, believeth all things, hopeth all things) the Infant to believe, ſhe would not have appointed Sureties and Sponſors in the name and place of the Infant, ſo to aſnwer; and unleſs the Infant it ſelf had ſo anſwered, in the words and mouth of its Sponſors and Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhe, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Church, would have forbid it to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have told you of the ancient manner of the Primitive Baptiſms with Sureties and Sponſors; you muſt not now here call upon me for proof hereof out of the plain and direct Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for I acknowledge this ancient Cuſtom, and many a one in uſe amongſt the firſt Chriſtian Churches, is not expreſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Scripture (for then it might be concluded abſolutely neceſſary for all ages and perſons to follow) ſo neither is it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden explicitly in Scripture, and therefore not utterly to be rejected, as unlawfull to be uſed, as which was for the good of the Infant (and hurs of none, as having neither impiety nor iniquity in it) ſo alſo it was for the proviſion and better education of the Infant, the edification of the Church, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:168478:49"/>the demonſtration and exerciſe of Charity to, and charitable judging of others. Inſomuch, that as thoſe venerable Names and Lights of the Ancient Church, <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Augu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tine,</hi> have related and delivered that Cuſtom of baptizing with Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Sponſors: ſo other Reverend Names and Lights of theſe Modern reformed Churches, as <hi>Luther, Zanchy, Beza,</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, approved, and commended the aforeſaid Cuſtom, as fit to be retained ſtill.</p>
                     <p>From all which it now appears, that you (Sir) are much out, when as you talk and tattle of the Churches baptizing Infants upon account of faith in the Sureties, although they have none of their own; for (you ſee) it was not upon the account of the faith of the Sureties, which the Sureties had of their own, that Infants ever were baptized, but upon the account of the faith of the Infant, which the Infant had of its own, teſtified and profeſſed in their name, by the Sureties (appointed by the Church, which judged charitably of the Infant, to beleive) that the Infant was baptized.</p>
                     <p>But now, before I proceed to the next, I will call upon you to conſider, That your Doctrine of baptizing actual Believers onely, and thereupon not baptizing the Infants of Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they have actual faith, and can and do make confeſſion of it, doth rather overthrow, as much as in you lieth, the nature of the Covenant of Grace, and the whole Goſpel of Chriſt, at leaſtwiſe to the Seal thereof, all the while from their birth, that ſuch Infants are kept by you from the ſame Seal of Baptiſm (for you cannot keep them from their Covenant, though you do ſhamefully, ingratefully, ungraciouſly, yea and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally keep them from the Seal.) The thing is evident enough, if you do but remember, this is the nature of the Covenant and Goſpel of Chriſt, the Promiſe of God, to be the God of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parent and his Seed joyntly, therefore alſo of his child as ſoon as its born; yea before, when it is his Seed; and ſoon after its birth, Gods will is declared to have this Covenant exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and confirmed by an initial Seal of Circumciſion upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, in the Old, and of Baptiſm upon Infants in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; now, who overthroweth this Covenant, we, who put our Infants under the Seal of the Covenant, ſoon after their birth, (it being their birth-right) or you, that with-hold it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:168478:49"/>from your Infants, until they come to be of years to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, let God himſelf be judge, and that his Word, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 17.14. <hi>He hath broken my Covenant;</hi> who? the child, whoſe fleſh of his fore-skin is not circumciſed: ſo alſo he, whoſe fleſh is not waſhed with the water of Baptiſm; which latter, if not done, or ordered to be done by you, who are Parents to the Child, the breach and overthrowing the Covenant lieth upon you, and not upon the child, to anſwer for. You have broken the Lords Covenant, and the Lord may break in upon you, as he did upon <hi>Moſes</hi> for neglect of circumciſing his Seed, <hi>Exodus</hi> 4.24. Conſider of it, its the Lords mercy you are not broken and conſumed; let the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long ſuffering, lead you to repentance; the Covenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, Chriſt being the ſame under both Adminiſtrations, God will look (and juſtly may and muſt) that his Covenanters or covenanted with, even Inſtants, ſhall be now partakers of Baptiſm in a proportionable time (if there be no intercoming excuſable impediment) like as the ſame were of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
                     <p>And now alſo, before I ſet upon your next Conſideration, conſider with your ſelf, whether your Doctrine of baptizing Believers onely, and thereupon your not baptizing of Infants of Believers, until they come to have actual Faith, and to a confeſſion of it, doth not rather overthrow the ſtate and nature of Chriſts viſible Church under the Goſpel? I have largely proved before, and that out of Texts you here cite to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Romans</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2, &amp;c. That Chriſts viſible Church under the Goſpel conſiſteth and is made up of viſible and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward members and profeſſors, (ſome of which, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known unto us, are members alſo of the inviſible Church under the Goſpel) and I have alſo clearly ſhewed you, that Baptiſm is a means of entrance and admiſſion into the viſible Church; whereby Infants (who by vertue of Gods Covenant may alſo belong to the inviſible Church as members) are reckoned &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, &amp; even made members of the viſible Church.

                        </gap>w then, whether of us do overthrow the State and Nature of Chriſts viſible Church under the Goſpel, we, who help to uphold and increaſe it, by our ad nitting and initiating of our Infants to be viſible members thereof through our baptiſing of them in their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:168478:50"/>Infancy, or you, who, by your not baptiſing of them for the ſpace of 15. or 16. years and more, and ſometimes as much more, do all that while with-hold viſible members from the Church, yea and do all that while leave them to a viſible ſtanding and being under the kingdom of darkneſs, (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly it may be otherwiſe) which is moſt oppoſite to the Church of Chriſt, Let the next Reader judge, for you are neither fit nor able to judge herein, as who are already prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, prejudicated, and prepoſſeſſed with a Spirit of deluſion as to the Nature and State of Chriſts viſible Church under the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 You bid me, Conſider, <hi>That Infants babtiſm, it overthrows the end for which true babtiſm was appointed, For the Chief one of Chriſts true babtiſm of beleevers, was to diſtinguiſh the true Church from the World:</hi> Col. 2.12.

                     <p>Sir, I not think of it until juſt now, or elſe I ſhould have asked you, a Quaere, Why you alwayes write it Bahatiſm, when as you are ſo great an enemy to Babe-baptiſm?

                     <p n="1">1. It is an unſound and lame aſſertion or propoſition, to ſay, that Infants baptiſm is to be rejected for ever, (as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude your Conſiderations with, and therefore mean ſo in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one) if it ſhould overthrow one chief end, for which true baptiſm was appointed, when as in the mean, it upholds five other ends, as chief, if not chiefer, which I have reckoned up to you in my fift warrantable Reaſon for baptiſm, to which I refer you.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168478:50"/>why true baptiſm was appointed? becauſe it overthroweth the chief one, which was to diſtinguiſh the true Church from this; but how if there be the ends, as well as the end why true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was appointed? how, if amongſt the ends, there be chiefer ones, than that chief one you mention? how, if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-baptiſm do not overthrow thoſe five chiefer ones, though (ſuppoſed onely) it ſhould overthrow one chief one? Here be now ſome Quaeres for you.</p>
                     <p>But now, how prove you alſo, The chief one end of true baptiſm to be, to diſtinguiſh the true Church, from the world? you cite, <hi>Col.</hi> 2 12. and 20. There is mention made of baptiſm and the world, and a ſpiritual end and effect of baptiſm, that therein the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were buried in Chriſt and riſen with him, (alluding to the ancient manner of baptiſing by immerſion and emerſion, to ſignifie them both,) &amp; they were freed from the Rudiments and Ordinances of the World, that is of the Legal oeconomy of the Jewes, and what's all this to the purpoſe of baptiſms being a chief end, to diſtinguiſh the true Church from the Heathen World, which is alſo but an external end? And though the Text ſpeak of grown perſons, and Heathens converted, yet it is true alſo of all elect and regenerate Infant (of which there are many you cannot deny it) that they are buried with Chriſt in baptiſm, and riſen with him, &amp;c. So that you get nothing by this Text, againſt Infants-baptiſm, They rather gain by you hence for their baptiſm; But ther's nothing at all gained for the diſtinguiſhing the true Church from the World by baptiſm, as the chief end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>So that other Text, <hi>Galathians</hi> 3.26. Is nothing to your purpoſe, yea againſt your purpoſe, for it ſpeaks onely of the inward and ſpiritual effects of Baptiſm, and of baptiſm into Chriſt, that thereby the <hi>Galathians</hi> had put on Chriſt, and were ſo incorporated, as they were one in Chriſt, ſo that there was neither Jew, nor Gentile, bond, or free, &amp; So far is this Text from ſhewing the diſtinction of the true Church from the World, to be the chief end of baptiſm, that it rather and onely ſhews, the ſpiritual Union of true Chriſtians with Chriſt, to be one end and a chief one, which alſo all Infants
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:168478:51"/>regenerate and baptiſed into Chriſt do attain unto, as well as theſe grown <hi>Galathians</hi> and converted <hi>Heathens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I profeſſe I never read in all my life time, Texts of Scripture, more impertinently cited, and I had once thought to have let your Citations of the word alone, and onely have replyed to your words; But that I honor the word, and you do diſhonor it, by citing it for that which is not in it, even as Chriſt ſaid, he honored the Father, but the Jewes diſhonored him, by ſaying, he came not from the Father. Your laſt place, though it comes ſome what neerer that the former, as to an external addition of the 3000. Souls unto the Church, by baptiſm, yet it as far from mentioning any diſtinction of the true Church from the world, and making it the chief end of baptiſm, as the other before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Infant baptiſm doth not overthrow but ſupport that end, the diſtinguiſhing of the true Church from the World: that is, from the World out of the Church, which is the Pagan and Heatheniſh World, (you muſt mean this, or elſe you ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſeeing there is a Chriſtian World, or a World of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, even all that profeſſe the Goſpel, and embrace Jeſus Chriſt) for if you mean by Church, the elect true beleevers; and by the World, the Reprobate and falſe Beleevers, within the ſame, neither our Infant-baptiſm, nor your baptiſm of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, (as you call it) confeſſing Faith, when grown in years, can make ſuch a diſtinction; for as amongſt our Infants, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the grown Beleevers baptiſed, there may be and are undoubtedly many Reprobates, &amp; Hypocrites, and Falſehearted Profeſſors; ſuch of both ſorts come to Baptiſm, without any diſtinguiſhing by us; and go from baptiſm without any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch by it.</p>
                     <p>And therefore 4. Is a pittiful reaſon you add, and I pitty you for it, that Infant-baptiſm doth not diſtinguiſh the true Church from the World, becauſe all are admitted in by it; True, all of the Church are admitted in by it, (What need a diſtinction in the Seal, where there is a conjunction in the Covenant) and this very admitting all of the Church profeſſing Chriſt, or born of thoſe that profeſſe Chriſt (upon both which termes, the Covenant runneth) doth evidently prove, that we hold ſtrictly, and uphold ſtrongly, the diſtnction of the Church
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:168478:51"/>from the World of Pagans and Heathens, whom we exclude-and keep off from baptiſm, untill they learn and beleeve the Goſpel and make profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>And now 5. Conſider, that your Non-baptiſm of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants until they be grown to great years able to profeſſ faith, &amp;c doth overthrow the end of bapttiſm and a chief one, the diſtinguiſhing of the true Church from the World, for that none of them are admitted into the true viſible Church, by it: for tell me, whats the diſtinction and difference betwixo the World-Infants, I mean the Infants of Pagans and Heathens, and the Church-Infants, the Infants of Chriſtians and Profeſſors, but this onely of baptiſm, admitting theſe into the viſible partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacion of the Covenant, and Communion with the Church of God, for want of which, the others are kept out as aliens and ſtrangers, until they by faith and confeſſion come to claim the ſame Seal of admittance.</p>
                     <p>I ſay again conſider this, and lay it cloſely and ſeriouſly to your heart, that during the years you detain uyour Infants and Children from baptiſm, which is their birth-privilege and their Covenant-Seal and their diſtinction-mark, you leave them in a Heatheniſh and Gentile ſtate, as Aliens and ſtrangers from the XCommom wealth of ChriſTians, and Covenants of Promiſe, Them, I ſay you leave without Hope, as being without the Seal of the Promiſe, and your ſelves in doubt, about them. The revealed things belong to you and your Children; The Promiſe, and the Promiſe to be ſealed, belongs to you and your Children, to your Children, upon their birth, as their Privilege and due, Let them have it, and leave the ſecret things to God, to whom they belong, their Salvation by Election; for he that elected them to ſuch an end, hath elected them to the means.</p>
                     <p>And thus you have been thrice overthrowing of Infant: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, yet have you not given is any fall: For though in words you ſeem to make is the great overthrower, as if it overthrew the Covenant and Goſpel, the viſible Church, the ends of true baptiſm, yet Infant-baptiſm, and all theſe ſtand ver, well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, each upholding the other, and though you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeem as the great <hi>Goliah</hi> and overth over to little <hi>David,</hi> and ſo have given theſe three retches and girds at Infan shap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:168478:52"/>its rather to your own overthrow, and of vour own bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and yet (I perceive) you have another ſtroke to come, in the 21 of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 27. God ſaid of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing to deſtroy it, <hi>I will overturn, overturn, overturn,</hi> and it ſhall be no more; but in your deſign for the ruine of Infant-baptiſm, you exceed the wrath and indignation and have gon beyond that threefold Ingemination, ſaying, I will overthrow, overthrow, overthrow, overthrow the doctrine of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. But as curſt Cowes have ſhort horns, ſo ſtrong words have (moſt an end) weak hands, you have done but little yet by your three highly and ſtrongly conceited conſiderations, and I (beleeve) the fourth will be like the ſormer. Which, becauſe there are ſo many, In and outs and round abouts in it, I will reduce it to a ſhort form.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The baptiſing of Beleevers or Deciples, is onely expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Scripture, as in</hi> Matthew 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16 15. <hi>John</hi> 4.12 <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. and 41. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. and 38. <hi>But Infants bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm overthroweth and prevents that babtiſm which is onely expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly commanded in Scripture?</hi> Therefore what? you infer nothing, leſt it ſhould be a Syllogiſm, a Limm of the profane Univerſity human Learning, but I know your meaning, onely mend in your copy at home, <hi>(Deciples and Babtiſm)</hi> as you write here, and make it, <hi>Diſciples and Baptiſm,</hi> leſt your friends think you call the baptiſm of beleevers onely, a babiſm: and derive your Diſciples from <hi>Deciples,</hi> decipients or decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                     <p>You muſt pardon me, for not turning to your Texts, &amp; ſome of them I have already handled, &amp; ſhewed they were nothing to your purpoſe, and others, I ſhall meet within in a fitter place, I know them without book, that none of them all do expreſly command the baptiſing beleevers onely; Which they muſt do, if you cite them for your purpoſe: For who ever denyed the baptiſing of beleevers, as I have formerly written? Again as theſe Texts, do command, ſome of them, expreſly the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing of beleevers, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. So ſome other doth but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for, and propound Faith unto baptiſm of grown perſons, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. And another mentions faith and baptiſm as a joynt requiſit to Salvation, as <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. And another hath nothing at all in it either of faith, or baptiſm, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:168478:52"/>as <hi>John</hi> 4 12. And for the laſt place (in your paper, the firſt,) look back, where its largely handled, and you ſhall ſee (you might have ſeen it in the Text it ſelf) there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe command for baptiſm of beleevers, but of Diſciples, and therefore you did well to add, to beleevers, (or Deciples) and are not Children of beleeving Parents, Diſciples too, if not beleevers? you ſhall find (if upon your firſt reading you did not) Them alſo to be commanded there, under the Notion of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or a diſcipled Nation, (of which they are a portion) to be baptiſed, and much more to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly your Texts that do ſpeak of Baptiſm of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, mean it of Believers, being grown perſons and Heathens converted newly, not of Believers born and living within the Precincts of the Church.</p>
                     <p>But how (I pray) doth the Baptiſm of Infants within the Church, overthrow the Baptiſm of believing Heathens and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, grown perſons? they ſtood up together, both in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles General and National Commiſſion, by which the children of believing and baptized Heathens were to be alſo baptized; and in Apoſtles domeſtical and ſpecial Diſpenſation, when they baptized whole Houſholds of believing Parents and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. It is true, this Doctrine of thus baptizing Infants, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws your practice of baptizing onely Children grown, though born of baptized Chriſtian Parents, when they can give a reaſon of their Faith. I ſay Infant-Baptiſm overthrows this your Man Baptiſm in a ſetled &amp; planted Church; and you have not one Text to raiſe or lift it up, or hold up your ſelves, But I remember you joyned with Infant-Baptiſm overthrowing, its preventing alſo the Baptiſm expreſly commanded in thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alleged by you. What mean you, Sir, by ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juntion of overthrowing and preventing? for if that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth this, then it doth more than prevent; and if that doth but prevent this, it doth not ſo much as overthrow it. For my part, I think the one doth not prevent the other, but both were; joyned together, both in the Precept, Baptiſe the diſcipled Nations, the believing Parents and their children; as alſo in the practice, The Apoſtles having converted Pagan Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Houſes, I mean, the grown Parents, unto the Faith, baptized them and their children at the ſame time, or left them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:168478:53"/>baptizeable, and to be baptized of others, if they were in haſte of their preaching the Word; like as <hi>Abraham</hi> the Believer, and <hi>Iſmael</hi> his Son, were both circumciſed upon one and the ſame day. Sure if any one prevented the other, it was the old Adminiſtration (as you call it in this place) the Baptiſm of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that prevented the other, the Baptiſm of Infants; and not the other back way, as you affirm; for the Believers both of the Jewiſh and Heatheniſh Nations, were firſt baptized, and then their Infants were afterwards baptiſed, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was firſt circumciſed, and then the ſelf-ſame day was <hi>Iſmael</hi> circumciſed.</p>
                     <p>But let me hear and reade your Reaſon. You ſay likewiſe, <hi>Inſant-Baptiſm prevents the old miniſtration of this expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded baptizing of Believers, becauſe moſt of perſons look upon themſelves as baptized in their infancy, and ſo never look after the command of Chriſt to be baptized when they believe.</hi> What a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is here given of Infant-Baptiſm preventing, another Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſon expreſly commanded? namely the baptized perſons, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of himſelf, or looking upon himſelf as baptized in his infancy, and ſo never look after the command of Chriſt to be baptized when they believe. To let go the irrationality of this Reaſon, I muſt ſay again, that there is no ſuch old or new miniſtration of an expreſly commanded Baptiſm of Believers grown, after they have been once baptized in their Infancy; Your cannot wring or wreſt it out of the mouth of any one of your cited Texts; ſo far are you from deducing, and leading it fairly by the hand (as I may ſo ſay) out of them or any one of them. This of yours, ſavours too rankly of the old Hereſie, and new Schiſme of Rabaptization, ever condemned in the Churches of God, both of old, and of late, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved, from the Apoſtles caſting up this account, and bringing all Baptiſmes to this, as the total ſumme, that there is but one Baptiſm, and therefore once baptized, are not to be baptized any more. And therefore not onely moſt of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but all of the perſons baptized, are to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as baptized ſufficiently, and never to look after any other Baptiſm, commanded them of Chriſt when they believe, for there is none commanded.</p>
                     <p>Do you, Sir, expreſs it as if it were a fault or a fancy, that moſt of perſons look upon themſelves as baptized in their infam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:168478:53"/>and never look after to be baptized when they believe? Stop your ears (Oye baptized men, women, and children) at the voice of the chaarmers, for they charm neither wiſely, nor foundly, nor ſweetly, as to you and your good and benifit; not wiſely for you, but ſubtlely for themſelves and their party, who having forſaxen their firſt love, and renounced their firſt Baptiſm, now compaſs about to make your their proſelytes, and ſo two-fold more the children of Hell than themſelves, if ye after ſo many ſtrong Reaſons, and ſo fair a warning, will alſo renounce your Baptiſm, wherein ye renounced the Devil and all his works, A chief one of the DXevils works is, to draw peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to renounce their Baptiſm, the mark and Seal of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venane with God, &amp; Gods with them, as he uſeth to do with Wirches and Sorcerers, before he entreth into Covtract with them, and give them a mark and Seal of their Langue with him, and his with them.</p>
                     <p>Not ſoundly or truly for you, but hypocritically and falſly for themſelves, do they thus charm, as who onely do pretend the Word and Commandement, but can ſhew you none, nor example for any Chriſtian once baptized, who ever was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed again. The deſire to have you baptized again, as the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors would have had the baptized <hi>Galathians</hi> circumciſed, <hi>That they may glory in your fleſh,</hi>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:168478:54"/>or a troſtrating or evacuaring the Seal either way, a deſpiſing it, and a profaning of the Covenant of Grace? and will ye thus part with your Birth-right, firſt Baptiſm and ſell it (as it were) to theſe ſupplanting <hi>Jacobs,</hi> and all for a meſs of twice ſod pottage? ſuch is ſecond Baptiſm, or rebaptization, Will you leave your Manna that came down firſt from Heaven, loathing it, to luſt after, and hunt after theſe Quails, and liſten to their Quail piper, who ſay. What is this Manna? nothing before ouer eys but this Manna. Remember, that whileſt the fleſh of the Quails eaten in cintempt of Manna; was yet between their teeth ere the Quails were chewed, the wrath of God was kindled amongſt the people, to the ſmiting of them with a great plague (beſides that the fleſh afterwards came out at their noſtrils, and was loathſom unto them:) and ſo fear ye, left while the water of the new Dippers or ſecond Baptiſm, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in contempt of your firſt Baptiſm, is yee upon your heads, and ears, and faces, the wrath of God (which ever attends upon the contemners and deſpiſers of his Sacraments) fall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon you, and ſome or other curſe of God purſue you; ſo alſo, that ſuch water may be loathſom and noyſom to you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.

But that I haſten; and will tell you to the contrary, Look often back to your firſt Baptiſm in your Infancy, and think not upon any other Baptiſm after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) as to a Store-houſe of comfort in all time of your need: if you be tempted by the devill, and aſſaulted about your ſins, in your youth, or old age, think not now of ny new or ſecond Baptiſm, but recall thy firſt and old Baptiſm, oppoſe it againſt him, ſay and know, that therein God hath promiſed and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto thee the pardon of thy ſins, and the purchaſe of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>If thou beeſt troubled with doubtings, and weakneſs of Faith, Fetch from thy firſt Baptiſm, ſuch a ſtrengthening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and meditation (for the doing of which, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce another Baptiſm, is but a Fetch) that God hath given thee there, an earneſt and pledge of his loving kindneſs to thee, in the water ſprinkled upon thee, repreſenting the blood of Chriſt applyed to thee, and ſo (as when <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaw the Holes in Chriſts-ſide; and the print of the nailes, he ſtrengthened his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:168478:55"/>Faith againſt doubtings) be not thou faithleſs, but faithfull, when thou reflecteſt upon thy Baptiſm, and remembreſt the pouring out of the blood of Chriſt for thee, and the earneſt thereof, the pouring out of water upon thee.</p>
                     <p>If thou lieſt under any kind of Croſſe or Calamity whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, have recourſe to thy Baptiſm, in which God hath promiſed to be thy God, of which promiſe he will not fail thee, nor canſt thou be miſerable, having this promiſe, yea if God be with thee, who ſhall be againſt thee?</p>
                     <p>Thou doeſt often look upon the wills and Teſtaments of thy Father and Grandfather, when you are in a doubt of hour E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or in ſome trouble about it, or in want, to be reſolved in all matters thereabout: do the ſame here, look often back to thy Baptiſm, wherein the will of thy heavenly Father (which is this, <hi>I will be thy God</hi>) is delivered and ſealed, and thou wilt be well reſolved, comforted and cleered, in all Eſtates and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Onely look back alſo to, and remember as often, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Homage, and ſtipulation of obedience wherewith thou haſt bound thy ſelf to God, (by thy ſuerties, or prelenters of thee to Baptiſm;) now thou knoweſt and underſtandeſt it, thou muſt ſtand to it, nd make it good, thy part of the Indentures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Order of Baptiſm on thy ſide, which is to turn to God, and believe in Chriſt, and be continually renewing of thy Faith and repentance: and then there ſhall be no need of any ſecond Baptiſm, or waſhing in water, having the benefit and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of, and from the ſame Baptiſm at firſt.</p>
                     <p>For this alſo I will tell thee for thy farther comfort, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and efficacy of Baptiſm extendeth it ſelf to all actual ſins (like as originall) &amp; to the whole courſe of the life of man when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovever he ſhall believe and repent, and is not to be reſtrained to the time of the Birth and Infancy, &amp; ſo after the adminiſtration of it, Baptiſm hath the ſame force, it hath before, or in the time of its adminiſtring: for Baptiſm is of force, ſo long as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is of force, and that is everlaſting, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.10. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. The Papiſts indeed will tell you, as I have mentioned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that your Baptiſm will ſerve you only for Remiſſion of ſins, done before it, meaning your originall ſin, and ſo call your Baptiſm the firſt Table for Refuge as from it; and for ſins done
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168478:56"/>after Baptiſm, you muſt have their Sacrament of Pennance or Repentance, which they call, a ſecond Table for Refuge; (like as the Anabaptiſts tell you, you muſt have their Sacrament of Confeſſion, as I may call their ſecond Baptiſm, which they Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter upon Confeſſion, of Faith,) But I tell you both, are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſuperfluous, for your one, firſt, ſingle Baptiſm ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all, (you need no New Sacraments for the matter) as whoſe force and efficacy (though the rite and Ceremony were gone in an inſtant) doth extend it ſelf, to your whole life time and to all ſins, to be a ſeal unto you of the Remiſſion of all, original and actual, paſt and to come, ſo you will ſtill have recourſe unto it, and make application of the grace thereof offered and ſealed to you on Gods part.</p>
                     <p>For I do not mean, nor muſt you think, that the bare and empty Review or Remembrance of your Baptiſm, that ſuch an outward Act was done will be unto you, at all times, a Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your ſins, but it muſt be an effectual application of the blood of Chriſt, which is the virtue and power of it, that will do it; and this may be and is done, in the confeſſion of your ſins, and the profeſſion ſo your faith; I may rather ſpeak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, (than they do) and ſay that your Baptiſm is not ſo only the firſt Table for Refuge after Shipwrack, and Repentance the ſecond; but that Baptiſm is the firſt and one long drawing Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that may and muſt be drawn out at length into the Two Leaves of it, namely into and unto Repentance of ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith: at or upon which, rightly uſed and applyed, you and all true believers, and penitent ſinners may ſit down, and find plenty and proviſion of grace and mercy, or which, not ſo much as a Table or Plank, but as the Ark and Ship it ſelf, will ſave you; as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith.</p>
                     <p>So then, let the effects and fruits of your firſt Baptiſm be acted and exerciſed by you, aad let the force and efficacy thereof be ſeen in the reformation of your whole life: (for Baptiſm is a ſeal of a dying to ſin, and a riſing unto Newneſs of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. as well as a Seal of the Remiſſion of ſin, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.4.) and then you ſhall need no ſecond Baptiſm; and if not, your firſt will be fruſtrated, (and yet you can have no ſecond;) and I may ſay unto you Chriſtians, ye ſtiffnecked, and unbaptized in heart and eares, as <hi>Stephen</hi> doth the Jewes, <hi>ye ſtiffnecked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168478:56"/>in heart &amp; ears,</hi> when as you do not expreſs the force and vertue of your firſt Baptiſm, (as they did not of their firſt Circumciſion) in the renovation and reformation of your hearts and eares, <hi>i.e.</hi> life and actions. Therefore, when the Jews fell away from God, at any time, and were called to Confeſſion of ſin or profeſſion of Faith, the Prophets did not propound unto them a new or ſecond Circumciſion (as if the former were voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or vacated) but onely mind them of their firſt and onely Circumciſion, and their Obligation, in their Infancy, bidding them to Circumciſe the fore-skin of their hearts, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the inward Circumciſion, in converſion to God, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and inward part of that Sacrament. And ſo the Apoſtles uſed to call them that had ſinned after Baptiſm, as the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by name, who had fallen from the Grace of the Goſpel, to confeſſion of ſin and repentance to believe in Chriſt, telling them of their Baptiſm into Chriſt, &amp; ſo bringing and reducing them to that foretaken by them, and the order ſet down there, which is already mentioned, nor do we read either in Prophet or Apoſtle of any other new order, required afterwards, of the Baptizing them again, but only a renewing of their Faith and Repentance, the Order and Obligation of their firſt and once Baptiſm, by the Miniſtry of the word, and that other Sacrament, the Supper of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>In a word, learn now to practice thy Baptiſm, the inward part of it, to which appertains Repentance and Faith; and ſo look not only back to it, but into it, an find out there thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement and reſtipulation, and perform that now, that thou art come to knowledge thereof, and walk before God, in true obedience, and in good reſiſtance; and abrenuntiation of the Devill and all his works: For I would not ſuch a looking back to thy Baptiſm, as may put a vain confidence in the cutward element received by thee, ſuch a Reſpect or Contemplation of Baptiſm, as to truſt in the Elements, is a miſapplication of it, through corruption, and may well indeed, occaſion ſin, and encourage thee to a certain libertiniſin, &amp; licentiouſneſt in life; there are ſome who being reproved for their ſwearing, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and whordom take Sanctuary at their Baptiſm, as if it aſſured men wilfully trading in ſin, of the remiſſion of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance, and Faith; but reſt not thou in the outward
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:168478:57"/>Letter or Element of the water; but ſtudy the Spirit, and walk in the Holineſs of the ſame Repent of every breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and this Repentance will be, as a ſecond plank or board, after ſuch Shipwrack, to carry thee to the Haven of Happineſs, like as thy Baptiſm was a firſt ſtep and ſtair of thy entrance into the viſible Church, and ſet thee, as it were, a Shipboard, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ark ſealing Chriſt with his benefits unto thee, which ſhall not be pulled off and made Null, and therefore need not to be iterated. and ſet to again, the firſt being ſtill of force and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, to all true believers in Chriſt, and repenters of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have ſhewed you (Sir) how moſt men, yea all men who have been Baptized in their Infancy, may, and ought to look upon themſelves, as Baptized in their Infancy (which you ſeem to condemn,) and that to very good purpoſe and benefit; and whereas you adde, as the other part of your condemning them, for their not looking after the Command of Chriſt to be baptized when they believe, will you have them look after that, is not to be ſeen or found; nay have you ſeen or found out ſuch a Commandment? I pray Si lend, or ſell no ſome of your eye-ſalve to annoint our eyes, for by and from that eye-ſalve in the 3. of <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. (wherewith we have anointed our eyes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſts Council there given) we cannot ſee from the one end of the New Teſtament to the other, any ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement for perſons baptized in their Infancy, to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed when they believe.</p>
                     <p>And yet as if you had revealed and brought to light ſome rare matter of Salvation, you have a very ſcrious and devout epilogue, that it &amp; your conſiderations, <hi>ſhould be conſidered without a ſelfiiſh prejudicial Spirit, a Spirit willing to he guided by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord according to his word of truth, and the Scriptures truly red and interpreted by the Spirit of the Lord, which are quoted to prove the Aſſertions, It will appear to every honeſt and unbyaſſed Spirit that Infant-Baptiſm is a great and dangerous errour for ever to be rejected of every Soul that expects Salvation by Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> What a Cackling is here made upon the laying of an addle egge, or rather what a Crowing is here, upon the Treading out, of a few idle conſiderations? you have the faculty of entitling upon the Spirit, and the Scriptures that which they being the Spirit and Scriptures of Truth, own not, your conſiderations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:168478:57"/>(though very ſeldom you give interpretations (them you leave for me to make) quotatious, and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons enough you bring, and thoſe to no purpoſe or proof, as I have particularly demonſtrated, where you cite them, I leave it to the Honeſt and unbyaſſed Spirits, to judge and determine, whether the Texts you have cited, were pertinent to your Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or according to your meaning, or interpreting (if you have given any:) whether Infant-Baptiſm be a great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errour, for evewr to be rejected, becauſe now oppoſed of you, which ever was, a good and Religions Truth, ever pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed amongſt the Saintt, becauſe recommended of Chriſt and the Apoſtles; whether youts or mine be a ſelfiſh and prejudiciall Spirit (I confeſs, my Spirit is prejudiciall to yours, &amp; your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as your Spirit is prejudicate to mine, and thoughts.

                     <p>However you think ſo well of them, that you go on, to more of them, (when its time to have done with ſuch ſelfiſh things) and in the next place, offer to me, ſome of your conſiderations upon <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39.</p>
                     <p>The which if I thought, they were no more conſiderate, nor conſiderable, than your former, I would conſider a while upon it, whether or no I ſhould take them into conſideration at all, or paſs by them, as inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch indeed they ſeem to be, and upon the General view, I find them ſo: for in them all, there are nothing but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and ſolutions made to objections not ſet down; Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and denyals, of a ſenſe before it be any where mentioned; is not this Cart before the Horſe, which a Carter (methinks ſhould not do:) &amp; a conſideration, without conſideration, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> a Conſideratour (I am ſure,) ſhould not do; we had before, your judgment ſetled out of Quaeres; this is as bad, your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to no objections, &amp; your refuting, no Expoſition of ours.</p>
                     <p>Well, as all the way hitherto, I have ordered your matters for you, ſo (I ſee) I muſt do ſo ſtill, or elſe we ſhall make no work of it, at leaſt, have no orderly proceeding in it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, let the ſenſe of that Text be given, and the argument drawn out of it for Infant Baptiſm (which I will do for you:) and then after, let the refutation of that ſenſe, and

                        <hi>Peter</hi> having preached here unto the Jeſs, and laid to their charge the death and crucifying of Jeſus Chriſt, and brought them to ſome apprehenſion of their horrid ſins, at the 38 Verſe exhorteth them to repent and be baptized into the Name of the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, and to accept him for their <hi>Meſſias;</hi> the which he doth upon this reaſon and ground, mentioned in the 39 Verſ. and drawn from the benefit that ſhould redound not to the mſelves onely, but to their Children, by their believing in Chriſt. The which he proves from the Promiſe made to them and their Children. In plainer and larger words, thus it is.</p>
                     <p>God hath remembred his Covenant, in ſending that bleſſed Seed, in whom he promiſed to be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed; know ye therefore, that (as God made the Promiſe of Grace in Chriſt (to come and to be exhibited) unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> upon his believing, and took alſo his Children and Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into Covenant with him, not onely the natural Jews, but even amongſt all Nations whoever became followers of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Faith, ſhould by vertue of the ſame inherit <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Promiſe, That he would be their God, and the God of their Seed alſo, which ſhould alſo be taken into the ſame Covenant) ſo now this bleſſed Seed in whom the Promiſe was founded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now come and exhibited, would make it good to you all, Jews and Gentiles, who would believe in him; and (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your cruel practiſes againſt him, and your crucifying of him) if you will believe in this Lord of life, and your <hi>Meſſias,</hi> you ſhall thereby be in as good, or better condition, under this laſt Adminiſtration, for your ſelves and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as in the former; therefore deprive rot your ſelves by your impenitency and infidelity, of ſo great a benefit, as may come to your ſelves and Poſterity; for the Promiſe is made to you and your Children, &amp;c. what Promiſe, or the Promiſe of what? for ſo I will clear the Text of ſome exceptions; the Promiſe of the extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt? ſo ſay ſome of you, that you may the better turn this off from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers baptized. It is true, they are promiſed alſo in the Verſe before, and I acknowledge, they were Appendants
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:168478:58"/>to the Primitive Baptiſmes of the adult, and peculiar to the firſt times, for the more abundant confirmation of their Faith, as <hi>Act:</hi> 10 &amp; 11. who were converted to it from Paganiſm and Judaiſm. But (no doubt) <hi>Peter</hi> here aimed, and even pointed at that grand and fundamental Covenant of Grace made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, In thy seed ſhall all families of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> Such a Promiſe as this, of Grace, and the free remiſſion of their ſins, by that blood of Chriſt (though ſhed by ſome of them) ſealed in the Sacrament of Baptiſm, comes ſeaſonably to them, to pacifie their troubled conſciences, and cheer up their droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits; whereas the other Promiſe, of receiving the Gifts of the Spirit, that is, the extraordinary ones of ſpeaking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Languages, &amp;c. would nothing ſo properly and effectually have done it, as that was the thing then in hand to be done. And beſides, the Promiſe here ſpoken of, being a Goſpel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, was to extend to all alſo that were afar off, as many as the Lord ſhall call; and ſo it did paſs on in the general Tenders, Privileges and Effects, to the Believers of the Gentiles and their children, from that time, and ſo ſhall unto the end of the World. But you will not ſay (I dare ſay) That according to this Promiſe, the believers of the Gentiles and their Children have received, and ſhall receive, thoſe Gifts of ſpeaking divers and ſtrange Languages, throughout all Ages and Generations. Such a Promiſe was never made, and ought not to be challenged of God.</p>
                     <p>But (it may be) the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was but a perſonal and peculiar one, to him and his ſeed, to be taken In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant, and to become a viſible Church (I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed) <hi>i.e. Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and their children. No, it extended, we ſee, to the Proſelytes of other Nations alſo, and to all followers of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith, both Jews and Gentiles; and therefore the ſame Promiſe was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently renewed in Scripture, many hundred years after thoſe Patriarchs deceaſed, both to Jews and Gentiles, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.2, 3. and ſo ſhall continue unto the end of the World, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, until the very laſt calling in of the Jews; it being, as I ſaid, a Goſpel-Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſay you, it is granted, when any of the Children of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:168478:59"/>Believers come to be called, and do believe, this Promiſe ſhall be made good to them. But thus ſaying, you make the Promiſe to hold forth no more comfort or benefit to the children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, than the children of Pagans; and thus even <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould have no external privilege by this Promiſe, until they actually believed; yea thus all the Jews (but ſuch as were Elect, and truly faithfull) were cut off, as well as the Gentiles, from having any viſible communion in external privileges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Call here is either inward or outward; if inward, can none partake of the outward privileges, as Baptiſm, but ſuch as have that? We know thoſe are common to the Elect and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate. If of an outward Call, why the Infants of Believers enjoy this Call with their Parents, and ſo partake of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                     <p>And what if <hi>Peter</hi> here required repentance of ſuch as were in Covenant before baptiſm, are therefore Infants not to be baptized? ſo <hi>Ahraham</hi> was in Covenant, and an actual Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and juſtified in Uncircumciſion, and received Circumcift. on as a ſeal of righteouſneſs of Faith; and Proſelytes turned to the Jews, were firſt to make profeſſion of faith; were therefore none but ſuch to be circumciſed?</p>
                     <p>But if being under the Covenant beſufficient, to give a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per right to the ſeals of it, and the privileges of it, (as I ſaid) why-doth <hi>Peter</hi> keep ſuch a do with theſe Jeſs, being already in Covenant, to repent and believe before they were baptiſed? and why were none of them being in Covenant, baptized, but ſuch as gladly received the Word and believed? It is no where ſo ſaid, that none but ſuch were baptized amongſt the three thouſand ſouls. And as for the Jews, who receiving the Word gladly, were baptiſed, you muſt know, they were not now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it in Covenant, ſo as to acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and Saviour of the World, as who denied that holy One, and killed the Prince of life. True, they were born Jews, under the Covenant, in the firſt Miniſtration of it, and were circumciſed, and had the ſeal of their faith in Chriſt to come. But this being now antiqunted and out of date by the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, and theſe Jews having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Chriſt, and depoſed themſelves and their children from the Title they had to Chriſt, as <hi>Matthew</hi> 27.25. they ſo
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:168478:59"/>renounced the Covenant they had Title to by birth, and were now in a condition little better than Pagans, Chriſtians to be made; and therefore they were not to have the new appointed ſeals of entrance, which was Baptiſm, to aſſure them that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was Lord and Chriſt, until they embraced him by faith, confeſſing that he was come, and that Jeſus was he, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their crucifying him.</p>
                     <p>And thus having cleared the interpretation of the Text, I will give you a Conſideration of mine upon it, before I come to your Conſiderations, without any interpretation given of you.</p>
                     <p>My Conſideration upon it is this, That here is a good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for me, and for Infant Baptiſm, againſt you; and ſo as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaid of <hi>Adonijah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Kings 2.33</note> 
                        <hi>That be had ſpoken a word againſt his own life:</hi> I may ſay, you have brought in this Word and Text againſt your ſelf, and the life of your Cauſe; ſaid I a warrant? yea a very Command.</p>
                     <p>The words, Be baptized every one of you, you will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (I ſuppoſe) to be a word of command from <hi>Peter</hi> in Chriſts ſtead, and ſo from Chriſt by <hi>Peter.</hi> But the Command is, To baptiae Father and Child, I prove thus; Becauſe the Promiſe is to the Father and Child. The Promiſe is made to you and your Children, and therefore the Command is, Be baptized every one of you, and your Children. For if the Children of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have a right to be baptized by the word of Promiſe, they muſt have a right to be baptized by the word of Command, and ſo the other way alſo, theſe two being convertible Terms, the word of Promiſe, and the word of Command, having mutual relation each to other. So its in the general nature of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, there muſt be a convertibility betwixt the two parts that do contract, as the mutual Indentures ſhew, and ſo alſo it muſt be in the Sacramental Covenant betwixt God and man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the word of Promiſe, which is Gods part, and the word of Command, that contains the duty of man, in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Action. And ſo particularly it was in Circumciſion, in which Inſtitution there was a mutual neer relation and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility between the word of Promiſe <hi>(I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed)</hi> and the word of Command <hi>(Every man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child among you ſhall be circumciſed)</hi> ſo that as many of them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:168478:60"/>that had a right to be circumciſed by the word of Promiſe, had a right to be circumciſed by the word of Command; and ſo alſo the other way, turn it, and its as true.</p>
                     <p>Sir, my hand is now in, and I will give you another Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm.</p>
                     <p>Whoſoever are expreſſed in the Promiſe, Verſe 39. are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Precept before, Verſe 38. Be baptized every one of you.</p>
                     <p>But believing Parents and their Children are expreſſed in the Promiſe, Verſe 39. The Promiſe is made to you and your Children.</p>
                     <p>Therefore believing Parents and their Children are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Precept; and ſo both are commanded to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                     <p>There is no difficulty but in the firſt Propoſition; and in it there is none, by reaſon of the mutual relation, and reciprocal convertibility that is betwixt a Promiſe and a Precept in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venantal, and Sacramental matters, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>And whereas it may be ſaid, That a Promiſe may be without a ſeal, and this here doth not infer Baptiſm. It is true; but when men have once put their ſeal, then there needs muſt be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence and relation between that Seal and the Covenant. So here, though it was not abſolutely neceſſary, the word of Promiſe, or Covenant of Grace, ſhould be ſet forth by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeals, appearing to the ſenſes; yet God having once an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to ſignifie the inward grace, it is now neceſſary there ſhould be ſuch a mutual relation between the word of Promiſe and the word of Command, and the Seal alſo. But I come now to your Conſideration, upon the Text of <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 39.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider, that ſuch a being in the Covenant, as maketh Faith void, is no true being; But that being in the Covenant which is concluded from the Faith of the Parents, is ſuch a being, as maketh Faith void, therefore no true being. That this is ſo, I prove.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Title whereby any perſon hath once a being in the Covenant, by the ſame he may remain in it for ever; now then if any one hath ſuch a Title as to be within the Covenant, by being the ſeed of the faithfull, he may remain in it for ever, and ſo needs no faith
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:168478:60"/>of his own; and ſo by the ſame reaſon one may, all may; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all be the children of</hi> Abraham <hi>or</hi> Noah, <hi>which were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, all are in the Covenant, and ſo Faith needleſs in the wordl.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider that ſuch on Expoſitionas overthroweth the Promiſe, that cannot be a true Expoſition of the Text, but ſuch as expound a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Covenant from faithfull Parents overthrow the Promiſe. Therefore this Expoſition is no true Expoſition, for the Promiſe is upon account of faith in our own perſons, and not in our Parents; as appears in</hi> Hab. 2.4. <hi>compared with</hi> John 3.36. <hi>And that it doth overthrow the Promiſe, I farther prove, becauſe nothing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth the Promiſe but faith; and if faith be needleſs, then the Promiſe is needleſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sir, I can write no farther, being ſorry I writ out ſo much of your needleſs ſtuff; for to what purpoſe is all this? are theſe Conſiderations upon <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39? they might have been upon any other Text as well, which makes any mention of Promiſe, Faith, Children. And what is it, but ſuch an Expoſition as overthroweth the Promiſe? Why did you not ſet it down the Expoſition at firſt, and then conſider upon it? you alwaiet love to ſhuffle with ſhadows, and fight with fancies, and ſtrange <hi>Chymaera</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>Your purpoſe is, to except to the children of Believers being in Covenant, with their Parents: (for ſo I muſt ſtill be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon your earth, which is without form, and void, and darkneſs upon the face of it, like a Chaos) and you ſay it is a falſe being, as concluded from the faith of Parents, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth faith void.</p>
                     <p>Firſt I muſt tell you, that the being of children in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace with their Parents, was concluded by God jointly and together (in that Promiſe, I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed) both were in the Promiſes, and concluded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not one from another: both in the Promiſe, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate together, not one from another. Your expreſſions are uncouth, unheard in the Church; yet we may conclude thus, That if the Parent be in Covenant with God, then alſo <hi>his</hi> ſeed and children are in Covenant, not ſo much from, as for the faith of the Parents, God accepting of it, ſo as to Covenant with them and their Seed.</p>
                     <p>But grant your Concluſion in your own terms, what then?
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:168478:61"/>
                        <hi>Such a being in Covenant as is concluded from the faith of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, maketh Faith voyd,</hi> ſay you; and ſay I, <hi>what Faith, or whoſe Faith do you mean?</hi> Not the Faith of the Parents, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for the Baptizing of the Child, or the being of it in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, from the Faith of the Parents (as you ſpeak) doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm, eſtabliſh, and bring it into effect, than make it void: nor can you mean the Faith of the Children; for you hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to have no Faith of their own, as here you expreſly ſay, how can you ſay it is here made void, any way, which was or is no where extant at all? nor is Faith required of them as to any manifeſtation of it, for their being in Covenant, or taking the Seal; though theſe do require it of them afterwards: But the Proof that you bring, it being of, I know not what, nothing aſſerted before of you, or denyed of me, deſerveth to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in its kind, that is, by a Reproof; for thus you prove. <hi>That Title wherby a perſon hath once a being in the Covenant, by the ſame he may remain in it for ever,</hi> (I muſt caſt in a grain of Salt here, without which it is too freſh, yea, unſavoury: that is, (ſo long as he lives, and renounce not before,) whether he be one of our Infants, or one of your grown Baptized ones;) <hi>Now then if any one hath ſuch a Title, as to be within the Covenant, by being the ſeed of the faithful, he may remain in it for ever, and ſo needs no Faith of his own:</hi> Here's a rope of Sand, for my grain of Salt. I grant he may with the former limitation: and he that hath ſuch a Title, as to be within the Covenant, by being converted from Paganiſm, may do ſo too, and as one, ſo all may.</p>
                     <p>And he needs no Faith of his own, I hope you remember your ſelf, no Actuall Faith expreſſed, as elſewhere you write it, as to this purpoſe to give him Title unto the Covenant or Seal, which his being the ſeed of the faithfull doth; yet he needs Faith, to give him Title to the benefits of the Covenant, Juſtification and Salvation; and he muſt be alſo, a faithful ſeed himſelf. <hi>And ſo by the ſame reaſon one may, all may, and ſeeing all be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Noah <hi>which were faithfull, all are in the Govenant, and ſo Faith needles in the world.</hi> Sir, you riſe apace, but to no preferment of a Proof: before it was but, He needs no Faith of his own, and now, it ſhould but have been, they need no Faith of their own, becauſe by the ſame reaſon, one
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:168478:61"/>may, all may as you ſay: but inſtead of ſuch, you fly high and far, and ſay, And ſo, Faith needles in the World, becauſe all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> which were faithful, are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. I never met with a man that made or called Faith, a Coſt needleſs in the world, that is and may rather be called, that one needfull thing in the world: for though actual Faith be not needful in all, to entitle them unto their external part of the Covenant and the Seal, as in the Baptiſm of Infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (for whom it is ſufficient, that they are born in and under the Covenant of grace) yet it is needful for the partaking of the inward part and benefits of the ſame, and their being in Covenant, is an obligation unto them to believe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, &amp;c. as a part of their Aſtipulation.</p>
                     <p>Now then if I ſhould reckon up, the Company of your, And ſo, and ſo, and ſo, (which are the Formals of your proofs) I ſhall not need to go out into Lanes or Streets, and fetch in, the Blind, and the Halt, and the Maimed, to fill up the Room, ſo long as your Reaſons, Proofs, and And ſoes are in preſence, for they ſupply us fully, as thus; The Children of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> who were Loyall, are joyned in the ſame Copy of Court-roll, and ſo Fealty is needleſs in the Mannor: or thus, your Plough lyeth in the Field, with its whipple-trees, and ſo rain is needleſs in the County.</p>
                     <p>And a man may ſee, you underſtand very well the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, to be a Goſpel Covenant of Grace, for the Remiſſion of Sins, and Salvation of Soules in and through Chriſt promiſed, who joyn thereto together, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> and his Covenant, without any diſtinction, or difference made, whereas the Covenant God made with <hi>Noah,</hi> was but a Covenant of Nature (as I call it for diſtinction ſake) for the Continuation of the world, and preſervation of the Creatures, and fruits of the Earth, to which he alſo annexed as his ſign, his Bow in the Clouds, That Rain bow: Are you of the mind of thoſe, ſome of your Cut and Size, who when they are put to it, and pent up by our Reaſons for Infant Baptiſm, from Infant-Circumciſion, ſtick not to ſay, that God meant no farther in his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, than that he would give him and them a viſible ſtanding in the promiſed Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and Circumciſion ſhould be the ſeal of it? if There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168478:62"/>you joyned <hi>Abraham and Noah</hi> together in your proof and diſcourſe, you thereby ſhewed, that you are not of <hi>Abraham,</hi> your Father, nor as <hi>Noah,</hi> a Preacher of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>But you call of me to Conſider, <hi>that ſuch an Expoſition as overthroweth the promiſe, that cannot be the True Expoſition of the Text,</hi> it is granted, but where, what is that Expoſition? ſuch as expound, a being in the Covenant from faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, overthrows the promiſe: it ſeems you are got up again, and come to overthrowing again: But how do you prove, that Expoſition overthroweth the promiſe. Firſt, By reaſon taken out of a Text out of <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> becauſe the promiſe is upon the Account of Faith in our own perſons, and not in our Parents: And ſecondly, becauſe nothing anſwereth the promiſe but Faith, and if Faith be needleſs, then the promiſe is needleſs; and this I muſt take upon your bare word without any Text. Moſt of this is anſwered already, if you will read back. You bid me here compare <hi>Habakkuk</hi> with <hi>John;</hi> I pray compare your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and the Promiſe together.</p>
                     <p>The Text ſaith, the Promiſe is made to you, and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to all a far off; (I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed) where you ſee, Children are Covenanted joyntly, and together with the Parents: you frame an Expoſition, and would put it upon us, Childrens being in the Covenant, is from faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parents, as if ſeverally, and a part faithful Parents were taken into Covenant, and then from them their Children ſhould, becauſe born of them, and when born of them, come into Covenant; for <hi>Abraham,</hi> believed whil'ſt he was in uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but that Faith of his, gave no being in that ſpeciall Covenant, either to himſelf or children, whereof Circumciſion was the Seal: but yet God ſo well accepted of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, that for its ſake, he was pleaſed to enter into Covenant with him, and with his children at one and the ſame time, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them together into Covenant with himſelf: So there the childrens being in Covenant, is not from faithful Parents, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely, as I have ſhewed, but from faithful Parents in Covenant: or rather (to ſpeak properly and fully) from the Covenant God made unto both, Parents and Children, ſo that not ſo much their being in Covenant, as their being born in Covenant, is from their Faithful Parents in Covenant.</p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:168478:62"/>
                     <p>But neither way doth it overthrow this Promiſe; for the childrens being in Covenant, by vertue of the promiſe made, ſupporteth and ſuppoſeth the promiſe; and their being in the Covenant, from faithful Parents, as you ſpeak, doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the promiſe, ſeeing even their being ſo is, from them, by reaſon of the promiſe made to them for their Children alſo, which rather eſtabliſheth and confirmeth, than overthroweth and evacuateth the promiſe. You had need add another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to your Expoſition, and put better light to your New light, and into your dark Lanthorn, or elſe none will ſee to walk by it but your ſelf; and ſo you have done. <hi>For it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the promiſe, you ſay, becauſe the promiſe is upon account of Faith in our own Perſons, and not in our Parents.</hi> See how you forget your ſelf, in forgetting the Children, of whoſe being in the promiſe, you are diſcourſing; you let them alone, and put your ſelf (and would joyn me with you, but that I will not) in their place, ſaying, the Promiſe is upon account of Faith in your own perſon, and not in your Parents. True, now you are a grown man, the promiſe will be, and muſt be accounted to you, upon the Faith in your perſon, as to the vertue, efficacy and effects of the promiſe. Now you are become <hi>a man,</hi> you <hi>muſt put away Childiſh things,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. to which purpoſe onely your Texts are, out of <hi>Habakkuk</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> where Juſtification, and everlaſting life, are ſet upon the account of Faith in a mans own perſon, ſpeaking of ſuch one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as are grown to be tall proper men like your ſelf, able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and give a reaſon of them.</p>
                     <p>But why did you ſingle out <hi>John</hi> 3.36. where the words of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> are not repeated, and bauk thoſe other Texts in the Margent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. in all which the very words of the Prophet, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his own Faith,</hi> are repeated and applyed? is it to ſhew in your own perſon, that <hi>light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs more than light?</hi> you turned onely to <hi>John,</hi> for Name ſake, out of ſelf-love; (yet I tell you, the Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> is againſt the the Anabaptiſt <hi>John,</hi> even herein, in that very thing for which you cited him, as I have ſhewed you) but if for Truth ſake, out of love to the Truth, you would have compared <hi>Habakkuk</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> in any of the three Texts, the Margent directed you
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168478:63"/>to, (yea, the whole Books and Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians</hi>) they would have given you a cleer Elucidation, if you would lay aſide your own Spectacles, and look with theirs, that your Juſtification, and everlaſting life is there, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſet upon the account of Faith in your own perſon, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your ſelf the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains rather the Execution of the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>But whats all this to the Promiſe it ſelf here mentioned, and of old made to the believing Parents, and their Children in their Infancy? Sure when you were a Child, you ſpake as a Child, you underſtood as a Child, you thought, or reaſoned as a Child, you reckoned and accounted as a Child: I pray now give me ſome account, (becauſe you make an inſtance in your ſelf,) paſſing by the Faith in your Parents, of the Faith was in your own perſon, when you was a Child, and went to Baptiſm, by which you lived; or inſtance now again, in the Children of faithful Parents amongſt the Jews, what account of their Faith, did any of them make in their own perſons, when they were Circumciſed in their Child-hood; or here in the 2. of <hi>Acts,</hi> which you have taken upon you to expound, what word, or ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, or the leaſt intimation is there, of any account of faith to be made of Children in their own perſons? And yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Covenant is both here ſaid to belong to the Children, and the Children before, and ſo likewiſe to your ſelf, Sir, all the while before you could, or did give an account of Faith in your own perſon; you would be loth to be accounted all that while to be without Chriſt, and an alien or ſtranger from the Covenants of Promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world; and if you ſhould think or ſay ſo of your ſelf, yet I will not ſo account of you, and you would be very ungrateful unto God, Covenanting, and Promiſing, and ungracious to your Parents bringing you into the world, and to Baptiſm, in ſo thinking or ſaying: It is as cleer as the light at noon day, that <hi>Feter,</hi> to perſwade thoſe enemies, and Crucifiers of Chriſt to Repent, Believe, and ſo to be Baptized, and to come under the New adminiſtration of the Covenant of Chriſt exhibited in the Goſpel, whom they had renounced, uſeth this as a main ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, the Benefit alſo that ſhould redound to their Children, that they ſhould alſo be accepted into Covenant, and be made
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:168478:63"/>partakers of the external Privileges of the Church, as to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and Counted Gods people, like as before they were Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and ſo reckoned; which he proveth, for the Promiſe is made to you and your Children, as to them and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: to you indeed, upon account of your actual Faith in your own perſons, but unto them, upon account as I have given before, of their being taken of God, into the ſame Covenant with you, their believing Parents.</p>
                     <p>But for all this, Though Children without account of Faith in their own perſons, by their Birth of believing Parents in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Promiſe, have Right and Title to Baptiſm, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Promiſe and Covenant made to them both, (Thy God, and thy Seed,) yet Children, when they come to enjoy the Benefits of the Covenant in their Juſtification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they muſt have theſe upon the account of Faith, in their own perſons, or ſome grace of the Spirit anſwerable applying Jeſus Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs unto them.</p>
                     <p>Your other Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe nothing anſwereth the Promiſe, but Faith, and if Faith be needleſs, then the Promiſe is needleſs.</hi> You did well to add no Text here, having abuſed enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: but let us look upward, and ſee what its you prove, <hi>And that it doth overthrow the Promiſe, what is it?</hi> the Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Text, <hi>Act</hi> 2.39. <hi>of Childrens being in Govenant from Faithfull Parents, that it overthroweth the promiſe,</hi> I prove farther, <hi>becauſe nothing anſwereth the promiſe but Faith;</hi> thus then it muſt be reaſoned; <hi>if nothing anſwer the promiſe but Faith, then Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens being in Covenant from Faithfull Parents, overthroweth this promiſe;</hi> I am ſure, This is a needleſs conſequence; becauſe the promiſe ſtands up ſtill, and is of ſo ce, notwithwanding though there were no Faith in ſome to uphold it; and much more, though no Faith in ſome to anſwer it. I will give you a Text here, though you give me none, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3, and 4. <hi>What if ſome did not believe? ſhall their urbelief make the Faith of God</hi> (the Faith made and given of God) <hi>i.e. this promiſe, without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? God forbid: yea, let God be true, and every man a lyar;</hi> Let Gods promiſe ſtand, though ſome mens faith fall: yea, though none in the world had believed, yet God would have fulfilled his promiſe, in ſending and exhibiting the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> a Chriſt; and therefore much leſs is the promiſe overthrown, becauſe there
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:168478:64"/>may want Faith in ſome, for ſome while, to anſwer it: If indeed there were no Faith at all extant or to come any where to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Covenant, and promiſe, this might ſeem to endanger the overthrowing of it, as to the taking effect and benefit in men; and then your reaſon would be of ſome ſeeming conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or your conſequence carry ſome ſhew of Reaſon. But it is not ſo here; for here is Faith in the faithfull Parents (as you acknowledge) embracing and holding up the promiſe; and here are Children in Covenant, upholding alſo and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſe, by birth of Faithfull Parents, by grace, and indulgence of God, and (for any thing you know) by Faith or other influence of the Spirit: Look again into the Text of <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. See if the promiſe there be not ſtanding faſt and firm to the believing Parents and their Children, though there is no mention made of Faith to anſwer the promiſes, but only called for of thoſe grown men that were to be, and were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
                     <p>But which way do you mean, Faith anſwereth the Promiſe? For one thing may be ſaid to anſwer another, many wayes, as the Antitype doth the Type, the thing ſignified the Sign, a thing regulated the Rule, the conſideration a bargain, performance a contract, or a Condition a Covenant. I ſuppoſe it is this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, that Faith anſwereth the Promiſe; For as the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood all in Preceps, Do this &amp; Live, and ſo works as the Condition were to anſwer that Precept; ſo the new Covenant ſtood all in Promiſer, I will be thy God, if thou wilt truſt to me, and Faith, as the Condition, is to anſwer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, elſe no proportion or agreement betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>For nothing but Faith it is, that anſwers the promiſe, it being impoſſible to have made the Sons of men partakers of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that other way, by obedience to the Law; if it could, it ſhould have been done that way: <hi>Adam</hi> (though made perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Righteous, and able) did not anſwer it; and if God had tryed <hi>Adam</hi> the ſecond time, he would not have anſwered, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it; but would have broken it again, and ſo ſhould we; Therefore it muſt needs be by Faith embracing the promiſes and ſo amſwering them, that the Covenant of Grace muſt be made ſure unto us, which otherwiſe could never have been done.</p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:168478:64"/>
                     <p>But all this maketh nothing againſt the expoſition of the Text above of Infants being in Covenant with their faithfull Parents, and included (yea they are expreſſed) in the promiſe; for God looked upon the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he entred into Covenant with him and his Children, and made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be the God of him and his ſeed; and hereupon himſelf was Circumciſed and his ſeed: And where God pleaſeth, and when he pleaſeth, as he doth give ſanctity, &amp; the Spirit, and other Graces to Infants, as to the Innocents, <hi>Jeremy,</hi> &amp; <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap.</hi> ſo the habit of Faith infuſed, (it being the Condition on mans part, yet wrought in every Elect Infant by God,) whereby they anſwer the promiſe, as to the good and benefit of the Covenant, if they dye before, or ſoon after the Sealing thereof by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, beſides that Infants being born of Parents in Covenant, and themſelves alſo in Covenant with God, and others, as ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſponſors, in the name of the Infants anſwering for their Faith, and promiſing for their education in the Faith, and the Churches charitable opinion, or judging them to have Faith, are ſufficient to anſwer the promiſe, as for the outward viſible ſeal which is Baptiſm, to be conferred upon them.</p>
                     <p>But you make an anſwer to an objection, which will make alſo an anſwer to the promiſe; <hi>If any will ſay,</hi> (ſay you) that <hi>the Parents may believe for their Children, and ſo their Faith will anſwer the promiſe, I anſwer;</hi> 1. <hi>That the Text doth not ſay, the promiſe is made to you, in the behalf of your Children, but to you, and to your Children; and therefore you muſt believe for your ſelves, and they for themſelves, or elſe neither you, nor they do anſwer the promiſe.</hi> Somewhat of this before.</p>
                     <p>Sir, whileſt you are about this promiſe, I wiſh you would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the precept, of uſing no vain repetitions, as here you do, ſo that I muſt either wholly omit, or repeat vainly with you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Though the Text ſaith not ſo much in ſo many words, yet it meaneth ſo much; The Promiſe is made to you, in the behalf of your Children (alſo) that word added, it is the ſame with, <hi>The Promiſe is made to you and your Children,</hi> both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and joyntly, the one being in promiſe as well and as ſoon as the other; and thus the Text neither ſaith, or denyeth your objection, nor your anſwer.

Whereas you ſay, Parents muſt believe for themſelves, and children for themſelves, or neither anſwer the promiſe it is truly meant according to the inward and ſpiritual part thereof, ſo as to partake of Remiſſion of ſin, Juſtification and Salvation: But yet the Faith of Parents in Covenant may be, and is ſo far beneficial to their born Children, that thereby they are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be alſo in Covenant with themſelves, and to have a Right and Title unto the Seal of the Promiſe, and the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances, and outward Privileges of the Church, and in reſpect of theſe may be ſaid to anſwer the promiſe. For the promiſe is, the whole Covenant and the diſpenſations of it in outward Ordinances, as well as ſaving Graces; and its your conſtant errour and miſtake, never to ſpeak diſtinctly of this promiſe, but uſually, and onely ſtrictly of the ſaving Graces thereof, belonging to the Elect, whereas there is an anſwering of this promiſe alſo, by viſible profeſſion, and external Church-memberſhip and privileges, which is done both by the Parents and Children, whether the inward Graces thereof be known or not.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Infants Faith, and their inward Graces, whereby you will have them alſo, and they may be anſwerable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſe, I refer you to what I have ſaid before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You Sir muſt own the Child above, and it muſt be laid at your doors. I mean the objection there made, <hi>That Parents may believe for their Children, and ſo anſwer the Promiſe.</hi> I do not believe you can find out a Father for it, nor did I ever reade the words, as I remember, it is true, as I have related be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Parents did anſwer for the Faith of their Children preſented to Baptiſm, when the Child was asked, doſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Parent, in the Name and place of his Child, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I believe; but this is far off from your Parents believing for their Children, for it was onely Parents profeſſing of their Childrens Faith; or the Childrens profeſſing their Faith by or in the mouth of their Parents, as I have largely ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>And as for thoſe Divines, who, though conteſting for Infant-Baptiſm, becauſe they could not be perſwaded of Infants-Faith,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:168478:65"/>made their refuge to Parents-Faith, yet they did it not in ſuch words, as Parents believing for their Children, nor to ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that their Faith might anſwer the promiſe, but to ſhew, that the Parents Faith gave unto their Children a proof of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born under the Chriſtian Covenant, and a Plea for the Seal of Baptiſm, notwithſtanding the ſuppoſed privation of Faith in Children.</p>
                     <p>Though therefore Infants, as to their inward ſtate before God, of Juſtification and Salvation, are not relieved and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forward either by profeſſion of Sponſors and Parents, or by the acts and habits of their Faith, becauſe as I ſaid, the juſt ſhall live by his Faith, and as you ſay, the Parents muſt believe for themſelves; and as the Errors and Hereſies of the Parents do not hurt the Children, no more do their Faith and Truth help them, as giving nothing from themſelves unto their inward and eternal condition. Yet are they beneficial to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren otherwayes. 1. Its from their Faith, that the Children are brought out to Chriſt, and offered and dedicated to him in Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Pſal. 206.37.</note> whereas the Infidels offered <hi>their Sons and Daughters unto Devils.</hi> 2. And as in their dedication, ſo by their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Faith of the Parent is helpful, towards the obtaining of their Childrens regeneration, and many graces of the Spirit, God being ready to hear, and do accordingly. 3. If original ſin did hurt Infants, which without any fault of theirs, they drew according to the fleſh from their Parents, why may not the Faith of the Parents profit the Children ſo, as that ſin be not imputed to them, for Chriſts ſake, to whom they are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dedicated purpoſely and willingly, by their Parents, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace is more abundant than Condemnation, and the gift greater than the fault? 4.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1 Cor. 7.14. Rom. 11.16.</note> It is from the Faith of the Parents in Covenant with God, that their Children born of them, are not unclean but Holy, <hi>and if the Root be Holy, ſo are the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So alſo for the obtaining of Temporal bleſſings, upon their Children, the Faith of Parents is avaylable: How often is God ſaid to beſtow ſuch, and ſuch good Temporal things, for <hi>Abrahams</hi> and for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake? <hi>Jeſus ſeeing their Faith,</hi>

                     <p>I thought it it would come to this at laſt: that, after your Railing upon the Church of God in <hi>England,</hi> for worſe than naught, even no Church, and after your baiting the Miniſters of God there, and, by your good-will, ill-will, your quaerying and tearing Gods portion of Maintenance from them, your
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:168478:66"/>Quarrelling at their Miniſtrations of the Sacraments of God, this eſpecially of Infant-Baptiſm, beſides abundance more of Gods inſtitutions and allowances, that you have been Quaeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous at, you would at laſt aſcend above the height of the Clouds, and fall to Queſtioning of God himſelf, about the performing and breaking his promiſe, about his ſaving all, or not ſaving all the Children of faithful Parents.</p>
                     <p>Either of which particulars, if you had been in your right wits, you would not have dared (yet what is it, you will not dare, in matter of Interpretation of Scripture, or argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reaſon?) to have drawn and enforced, ſo inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and inconſiderately, from that, though but ſuppoſed propoſition.</p>
                     <p>For ſuppoſe it again, that the promiſe was made to the ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the behalf of the Children, and they concluded to be in Covenant thereby, yet neither of the particulars, you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) doth follow, that all their Children muſt be ſaved accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Covenant, that ſo God may perform his promiſe; or if not, God muſt be a breaker of his promiſe: and ſeeing you have not proved the conſiquence, I will prove the Inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it; by the reaſon I have touched before, the Promiſe and Covenant made to the faithful, in the behalf of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and concluding theſe in the ſame, (I muſt here uſe your words) containeth not only the inward ſaving graces, and the ſpiritual benefits of the ſame, ſuch as are, Juſtification, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, perſeverance, and glorification freely promiſed in Chriſt: (if ſo taken only, then indeed all in Covenant muſt be ſaved, or elſe God be a breaker of Covenant.)</p>
                     <p>But it containeth in it alſo the outward adminiſtrations, in viſible Ordinances and Church Privileges, which are many, as to be Gods people, and the Children of Gods inviſible League, to have the Oracles of God, &amp;c. and thus taken, God is no breaker of promiſe, if all in Covenant with him, be not ſaved by him; for God made no ſuch Covenant with all faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to ſave all their Children, but to put them under the way and means of Salvation, by taking them alſo to be the God of, and owning them for children in Covenant, and appointing them a Seal thereof. This may be called the Covenant of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, or rather that part of it which ſtands in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:168478:67"/>of external Ordinances and Privileges; the which hath belonging to it all viſible and external profeſſors, as alſo a viſible Seal, which all that are in this Covenant, ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be partakers of; you (as it appears) allow none to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of Grace, but only ſuch as are inwardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Juſtified, Sanctified, and partakers of the ſaving Graces of the Covenant; The which error and miſtake, as I told you before, I tell you again, hath ſeduced you into theſe inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conſequences, and miſlead you into your Anabapriſmal Baptiſmes: for as many are called but few choſen, ſo many are to be reputed to belong to the Covenant of grace, and to be Covenanters, though they have not inwardly and effectually the ſaving graces of the Covenant. Beſides, I could prompt you, that the Covenant is but conditional, not abſolute.</p>
                     <p>And now, for a concluſion, becauſe you have made mention of ſuch a thing, the Salvation of Infants, born in the precincts of the Church, I will leave with you a few Propoſitions to conſider off.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Church of God determineth nothing poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peremptorily about the Salvation of Infants dying ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with, or without Baptiſm, for ſhe knoweth that ſecret things belong to God, and onely revealed things belong to her and her children.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. She judgeth that Infants in the general, Baptized or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized are ſaved, that is ſome, but not all; for this ſhe hath a judgement of certainty an charity both, both the charity and certainty of ſuch a judgement.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That this and that particular Infant, baptized, or unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized is ſaved, ſhe hath no judgement of certainty, but only of charity, and this may have, though there ſhould be none of thoſe particulars ſaved</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That inward ſaving grace, doth not alwayes attend the Covenant (largely and comprehenſively taken, of which before) nor the Seal, but only in ſuch as belong to the election of grace. Yet the Church may in charity think ſo; as to particulars in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and under Seal, (till the contrary appear) though ſhe have no certain knowledge of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Elect Infants Baptized, and dying in their Infancy, have no outward means of Salvation but their Baptiſm, the Seal of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:168478:67"/>Covenant, but there is an inward inviſible grace, which the Holy Spirit, before, in, at, or by Baptiſm, doth truly, really, and actually impute or impart to them, applying Chriſt in his Juſtifying, and Sanctifying vertue, unto the ſouls of ſuch Infants. This the Church holdeth not only as of Charity, but as of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Such Elect Infants Baptized, and ſo dying, are capable of, and do attain to ſuch ſaving inward graces, not by the uſual and ordinary way of Believing upon hearing and conceiving (for ſuch actual Faith, is not of abſolute nececeſſity to all Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, but only to thoſe to whom God affords the means of it.) it is the application of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, that juſtifieth them; which is done to them, either by ſome habits of Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed of God into their hearts, or by Gods Spirit in a ſecret and unknown way to us, ſupplying all defects in them, and doing all things on their parts; and this he holdeth, moſt in charity, with ſome though not, full of certainty, becauſe it is ſecret.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Such Elect Infants Baptized, and living to the Uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Underſtanding, the ſeeds of Grace and Faith infuſed before, or in Baptiſm, do grow up, by the ordinanry means, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an actual apprehenſion of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, yea areall poſſeſſion and comfortable fruition of Chriſt and all his benefits, which were in Baptiſm truly and effectually ſealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto them, whenſoever they ſhould be capable to make uſe of them: and this ſhe affirmeth both out of certainty, and charity.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Becauſe the Church (and all this while, I ſpeak of the Church of old <hi>England</hi>) hath no certain knowledge of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, who are Elect Infants, and who not; but only a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion of this and that, and ſo every particular one, born in the boſome of the Church; &amp; for that ſhe not only charitably holdeth, but certainly knoweth, that all Infants born of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents, are alſo inexternal and profeſſional Covenant of God, together with their Chriſtian Parents, Therefore ſhe is carefull, as ſhe ought, that all ſuch in convenient time and with the ſooneſt, may be Baptized, and receive the Initial Seal of the Covenant, ſo as none, as much as may be, depart out of this life, without Baptiſm, not as if ſhe certainly thought In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, having been true partakers of Baptiſm, muſt needs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:168478:68"/>doubt be ſaved; but becauſe ſhe will not be wanting in her charity, and duty to God and ſuch Infants, which being once baptized, and dying ſoon after, ſhe thinks them ſaved in her judgement of charity (in which ſhe thinketh the inward grace may accompany the outward Miniſtration) but for any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certainty and verity herein, ſhe diſclaimeth, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſame to the God Omniſcient.</p>
                     <p>Now to what end you add theſe laſt words, <hi>Jeſus ſaith, Ye do erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God,</hi> Mat. 22.29. <hi>I am the God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and Jacob; God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> Verſe 32. unleſs it be to ſhew a kinde of fatality of errour falling upon you, and following you whereſoever you go, not knowing, but pretending ever the Scriptures; which ſtill you cite, as heretofore, and ſpeak words againſt your own life (the life of your Cauſe) and cut your own throat with your own knife, or run your ſelf thorow with your own Sword, even the Sword of the Spirit, the Texts of Scripture, as you cite and apply them, as here: For by virtue of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſaith, which God ſo well accepted of, did not God enter into, and make a Covenant, both with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all other, both Jews and Gentiles, who ſhould be followers of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith? and God being the God, not of the dead, but of the living, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> liveth ſtill in the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who are of the ſame ſaith with him; and ſo the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> lives ſtill in all believing Parents, for themſelves and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>In that ſaideſt thou truly,</hi> John 4.18.</p>

And ſo I ſhall not need to leave off that I never began. But (truly) it is time for you to give over that which you have practiſed all along your Letter to me, the wreſting of Scriptures, and that to your own ends (if not deſtruction;) yea, I muſt tell you, (though you may wreſt the Scriptures to your own deſtruction, unleſs you ſee your errour and repent) you do not wreſt them to your own ends, I am ſure, for they do not come up, or attain, either to your own end, the deſtruction of our Infant-Baptiſm, or to your other end (for both theſe are your own ends) the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your Adult Baptiſm of perſons before baptized.

And I am farther glad to ſee you are willing to look into any of our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Books, that treat of Infant-Baptiſm, as here Mr. <hi>Wynell</hi> (whoſe Treatiſe, as I remember, I ſent either to you, or to a friend to ſhew you) and the rather, becauſe your Provincial Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts (like as the Provincial Jeſuites, do forbid unto their new Converts, and old Catholiques, as they call them, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Proteſtant Books) are cautious that our Oathodox Teactates come not into the hands and view of their Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Proſelytes. It appears to me, you have not ſo much as read Mr. <hi>Wynell</hi> about this Text (ſo far are you from reading over his Book) or not read ſo much as he wrote about it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you paſs by his Expoſition of it, and his Reaſons, and your Anſwers to them, and ſpend your time in drawing out of your ſelf and your own bowels, as a Spider, thoſe Cobweb-Conſideration of your own, ſpread out to catch Flyes, that will come into them.</p>
                     <p>Well, ſuppoſe it one of Mr. <hi>Wynell</hi>'s main props or pillars, he hath more beſides; and I thought that ſuch a <hi>Sampſon</hi> as you are, would have laid hold on both, or all the pillars of the houſe, and pulled them down: but inſtead of pulling down his, you ſet up firſt a prop and pillar of your own by his; and do interpret the Apoſltes meaning, of children being holy, to be onely from a Matrimonial holineſs, as born in lawfull wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:168478:70"/>and ſo to be nothing elſe in a manner, but a legitimation of birth: And here you cite <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 20. which ſpeaks of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and purity of meats to Believers; and <hi>Titns</hi> 1.15. which ſpeaks of faith purifying the heart, and all things after to the pure; and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. which ſheweth <hi>Marriage is honourable, and the bed undefiled,</hi> all to what purpoſe? forſooth to prove, that the holineſs ſpoken of children by the Apoſtle, was meant of a legitimation of birth; and the ſanctification there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, of a Matrimonial ſanctification? were they not rather to this purpoſe, to ſhew that a good memory, and a good wit, have not met in your head; who ſhew your good memory, to cite many Texts of Scripture, but no good wit to apply them, or to prove that out of them, for which you bring them?</p>
                     <p>Next you infer it from the ſcope of the words; <hi>For</hi> (ſay you) <hi>the words are part of an Anſweare</hi> (Anſwer) <hi>to a Queſtion put by the believing Corimhians, Whether that they which were converted by the preaching of the Goſpel, might live with there</hi> (their) <hi>husbands or wives, which were not converted? Now the Apoſtle anſwer thus, If the unbelieving husband or wife will dwell with the believing huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or wife is ſanctified to or by the unbelieving husband or wife; elſe ware your children unclean, or unholy. But now (ſaith he) by your dwelling tegether, and owning your former marriage (which was lawfull) they are holy and clean. This in ſhort is the genuen</hi> (genuine) <hi>meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in this Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This, neither in ſhort, nor at length, is the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in this Scripture; for according to this meaning, all the children of Heathens and Pagan-Parents, lawfully mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, as they may be, and many of them be, may be ſaid to be holy, and each of the Parents ſanctified to the other, by their dwelling together, and owning their Marriage, which was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Which things are nothing pertinent to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Queſtion, or the Apoſtles Anſwer, and quite wide, and fardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, if not wholly repugnant, to the ſcope of the words and meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in this Scripture.</p>
                     <p>To let paſs the non-ſenſe of ſome part of your Relation, and the confuſions thereof, as to the Queſtion and Anſwer, and your ſhortning, or rather curtailing of them, I will ſet it down to the full, becauſe upon this depends, as upon a prop or pillar,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:168478:70"/>the Frame and Fabrick of all Reaſons and Arguments.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Corinthians, before they received the Goſpel, and their converſion, were of the civil Heathens and Pagans, amongſt whom the men had their wives, and wives their husbands, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together in lawful Matrimony, according to the Cuſtoms and Laws amongſt them. Now when amongſt theſe married couplet, ſometimes the husband was converted to Chriſt, and became a believer, the wife abiding in her unbelief, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the wife was converted to Chriſt and became a believer, the husband rentaining in his Idolatry, (the Spirit blowing where it liſted, and grace being free,) the believing party began to have ſome ſcruple of Conſcience, (occaſioned, it may be, upon their knowledge of the Law in <hi>Hug.</hi> 2.12, and 13. or remembring the fact of <hi>Ezra</hi> 9, and 10. Chapters, or conſidering its faith, and the others infidelity, how ill they would comply toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) and thereupon ſent to the Apoſtle to have his reſolution and anſwer, whether they might retain, dwell and live with their unbelieving conſorts: to which the Apoſtle anſwereth, that if the unbelieving party, be pleaſed and willing to live and dwell with the believing parcy, the believing party ſhould not depart and leave the other; and giveth them this reaſon, for that the unbelieving party is ſanctified by the believing party: the which he aſſerts, by this reaſon, Elſe were your children unclean, but now they are holy.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe this may go for a ſecond doubt and ſcruple, of the Corinthians, reſolved here by the Apoſtle, for ſo ſure, when they ſcrupled whether their married ſociety, as husband &amp; wife were lawful in this reſpect, becauſe one party was an Infidel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, they doubted next concerning their children, whether they ſhould be holy with the believing Parent, which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or unclean with the unbelieving who was without the Church, and its Privileges, and therefore the Apoſtle, in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſpeaketh to the Caſe of children alſo ſo born, (as well as he had done to the other, concerning the Parents,) that their children alſo were holy, and not unclean.</p>
                     <p>Now (it ſeems) the Corinthians reſted well ſatisfied in their Conſciences, with this Apoſtolical reſolution of this double doubtful Caſe; for he ſpake as unto wiſe men, able to judge what he ſaid and meant, as himſelf teſtifieth of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:168478:71"/>But we have ſought out many inventions, and though they might be plain Caſes with us, being thus determined aforchand long ago by an Apoſtle, we have folded them, and perplexed them with many intricacies, about the ſenſes and meaning of the Canons of that Apoſtle.</p>
                     <p>As, what is that ſanctification, and how the unbelieving wiſe is ſanctified by the believing husband: and what is this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and how the children of ſuch Parents are ſaid to be holy and not unclean.</p>
                     <p>You have already and ſoon ſhot your bolts at both at once, and thus give the Genuine ſenſe and meaning, as you boaſt, of the Holy Ghoſt in this Scripture, that the former reſolution, Apoſtolical, is to be taken of Matrimonial ſanctification, as thus; the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the believing Husband, ſo that they are lawfully Husband and Wife: And the latter reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution Apoſtolical, is to be taken, of Natural holineſs (as you call it in your third Conſideration) ſo as the children of ſuch Parents were not unclean but holy; that is, not baſtards but Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimates.</p>
                     <p>And now I muſt skip over to that third Conſideration men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to finde out either ſome Text of Scripture, or ſome ſound of reaſon (there being none betwixt this and that.) <hi>There indeed I finde cited by you,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.3, 4. <hi>Wherein thus you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; in the</hi> 3. <hi>verſe the Apoſtle ſaith, For this is the will of God, even your ſanctificaion (or holineſſe: What is this ſanctification or holineſſe? it is laid down in the latter part of the verſe in thoſe words, that you ſhould abſtam from Fornication; ſo that from hence it appears, what holineſſe the Apoſtle meant before, even a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holineſſe or clean e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>,</hi> (cleanneſs) <hi>that is, not born of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the reaſon is in the</hi> 4. <hi>verſe, that every one of you ſhould know how to poſeſe</hi> (poſſeſſe) <hi>his veſel</hi> (veſſel) <hi>in ſanctification and honour: ſpeaking of Natural holineſſe and cleanneſs, of keeping their body,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſo their children come to be clean and holy, elſe were they unclean and unholy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, What a Reaſoner are you, your ſelf may ſee by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the 4 verſe a reaſon of the 3. verſe, which is only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it as to the perſons to whom he preſcribed the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of abſtaining from Fornication, and to the means thereof, that every one ſhould keep his veſſel or body in ſanctification, &amp;c. w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:168478:71"/>is the ſame thing in ſubſtance with the former. Secondly, You miſ-name the thing, as well as miſtake the reaſon: For it is not a natural holineſs or cleanneſs, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of or for, but a conjugal, or civil, or moral one; nor is Fornication or uncleanneſs, here, any natural, but a moral, civil, or conjugal thing, or otherwiſe an unconjugal, uncivil, and immoral, as all other vices and ſins are.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If this Text muſt prove the former Text, of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians to be meant only of Matrimonial ſanctification, (for I hope now you will leave off your Natural holineſs:) Why then this text (of the Theſſalonians, I mean) and the uncleanneſs and holineſs there, muſt be reſtrained to Fornication and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but this cannot be, becauſe other ſans are named and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in that place beſides it, as, <hi>that no man go beyond &amp; defraud his brother in any matter,</hi> at the 6. verſe; and then the Apoſtle at the 7. verſe, gives this as a reaſon common to both and all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, becauſe <hi>God hath not called us to uncleanneſs but to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſo that by holineſs there is meant not only chaſtity, but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice alſo and integrity; and by uncleanneſs, in juſtice alſo &amp; frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulency. For the will of God is firſt generally ſet down, at the 3. verſe, and ſpecified in two particulars, the one of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, along to the 6. verſe, in whcih verſe is another particular, of juſtice, and at the 7 verſe, the reaſon of both is yielded; For God hath not called us to uncleanneſs, but holineſs; which if underſtood only of Matrimonial uncleannes which is Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and holineſs which is chaſtity, then the Argument muſt run thus; let no man go beyond his brother in bargining, for God hath not called us to fornication but to chaſtity, and ſo you alone ſhall run with it for me, and follow the conſequence thereof, which I hold to be of no conſquence.</p>
                     <p>And fourthly, Such another conſequence is this; unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs, or ſanctification is put by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> to the Theſſalonians, for fornication and chaſtity, (ſuppoſe it ſo, though I grant it not ſo) and therefore the ſame is meant by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthian, when he ſaith, the husband is ſanctified by, or in, or to the wife, elſe the children were unclean, but now they are holy; as if the ſame words may not bear divers ſenſes, in ſcveral Text of Scriptures, according to the diverſity of the matter and ſcope; and how will you ſhew, that chaſtity among
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:168478:72"/>the Heathens and unbelievers, is ever called ſanctification in Scripture, the ſpirit only being the Spirit of ſanctification, and the bodies of Heathens and unbelievers, being not the Temples of the Holy Spirit: and yet (you ſee) the Heathen or unbelieving husband or wife, is ſaid to be ſanctified in or by the believing wife or husband.</p>
                     <p>And Fiftly and laſtly, The Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, grown perſons, converted to Chriſt, and tells them for the preſent and time to come, that it is the will of God, they ſhould abſtain from uncleanneſs and fornication, from fraud and injuſtice, (for the one of which you cite <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. alſo, the only t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, according the ſenſe of it,) and whats all this to the unbelievers being ſanctified by the believers, or their childrens being holy? Here was no ſuch mixt conjugal ſocieties of Chriſtians and Gentiles or Heathens, and children born of them, as appears in that the Apoſtles ſaith, Let every one of you poſſeſſe his veſſel in ſanctification, and not in the luſt of Concupiſence, even as the Gentiles, which know not God: I am ſure the Apoſtle neither ſpeaks nor means a natural holineſs or cleanneſs, that is, not born of Fornication, as you ſtrangly and inconſiderately blurt out; which words I leave to you to put into ſome Genitive Caſe, for the birth of I know not whom, the fathers or children of theſe Theſſalonians; for you make no Genuine ſenſe here, either of fathers or childrens Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holineſs or cleanneſs.</p>
                     <p>There is a parcel of your third Conſideration, clapt in by you, not belonging to the matter in hand there, which, according to my cuſtom of right ordering, and methodiſing of your confuſed ſtuffe, I reſerve untill anon, to come in its due and proper place.</p>
                     <p>I proceed, now that I have anſwered your Allegation for a Natural (you would ſay, if you were acquainted with the beſt ſpoken of your Sect, Matrimonial) ſanctification, Holineſs and cleanneſs: to give you my Reaſons to the contrary of your Opinion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the Apoſtle ſaith, the unbelieving husband is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the unbelieving wife is ſanctified by the husband: this cannot be meant of Matrimonial ſanctity and holineſs, that their Marriage was good and lawful, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:168478:72"/>chaſte, for both parties knew that of themſelves before, nor need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they, nor did they here propound any ſuch Quaere unto the Apoſtle, Whether they were at firſt or ſtill rightly man and wife, or were joyned, in lawful way of Wedlock whileſt they were Heathens. And that caſe was alſo determined before by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, as the 9, and 10. verſes, let not the wife depart from the husband, and let not the husband put away his wife: But the Quaere here was, whether the believing party might depart and ſeperate from the unbelieving party, a Brother or a Siſter, as its more explicated at the 12, and 13. verſes; ſo that it ſeems, this Quaere aroſe from ſomething in difference of Religion, that troubled the Conſcience of the believing party after his or her converſion, as whether it would not be defiled in remaining joyned to Idolaters and Infidels: Now ſuppoſe the Quaere had been ſent to you for anſwer (for I will ſee how good you are at anſwers, who are ſo much in Quaeres) what will you anſwer to theſe Corinthians? why thus you do: Be content, Sirs, you have a natural holineſs &amp; cleanneſs, or your Matrimony is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, notwithſtanding the difference in faith, you may live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for all that, you are no Adulterers and Adultereſſes, increaſe and multiply, your children are no baſtards but Legitimates.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, do you think this would have anſwered their Quaere, ſatisfied their ſcruple, or pacified their Conſcience? would they not have replyed to you, in the words of <hi>Job</hi> to his Friends, <hi>We have heard many ſuch things, miſeralbe Comforters are ye all. Job.</hi> 16.2? Tell us that we know not; anſwer us to that we Quaere you; ſpeak that we have not heard; we have heard many ſuch things, we know all this, that we are lawfully man and wife, and our children are no Baſtards but Legitimater; if this be all you can ſay, as good hold your peace, for you ſpeak no peace to Conſcience: Miſerable comforters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are ye all, or as in the margent, troubleſome comforters of conſcience are ye all, and by this your reſolution, make our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences more troubleſome and miſerable than before they were. Our doubts are, whether we that are converts and believers, may put away or go from our husbands or wives, which are Infidels and unconverted, and alſo his or her children, as not belonging to God for part of his people, or ſeed, and being as a grief and vexation, if not pollutionto us: what do you tell us of lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:168478:73"/>of our Marriages, or Legitimacy of our children? Can you ſhew us, there is any ſanctification, betwixt us and our unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſorts, whereby we may be induced to live and dewell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? any holineſſe, of our off-ſpring and children, that we may own them, as members of the Church of God? do this and do ſomthing, elſe its nothing you ſay.</p>
                     <p>But I will take off theſe Corinthians from you, Sir, and from baiting of you; (for which you may thank me) and will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them to a more happy and peaceable Comforter, ever their own Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who here fully anſwereth their doubts, and quiets their Conſciences, telling them, that the unbelieving husband is ſanctiſied by or in (the word in the Original beareth all) the wife; and the unbelieving wife is ſanctified by or in the husband, meaning (though not expreſſed) the believing husband and the believing wife. (I blamed you Sir, before for expreſſing it in the text (where the word, believing, is not for mentioning it as the fenſe and ſcope, which my ſelf now do) for the queſtion is, what the believing wife or husband is to do with the unbelieving husband and wife. Now this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſpeaketh to the heart (as the Hebrews ſay) of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, and bringeth a calme upon their troubled ſpirits, now if the unbelieving husband bepleaſed to dwell with his believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife, ſhe is well coutented, for the unbelieving husband is ſanctified by or in the wife: and if the unbelieving wife be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to keep with her believing husband he is as well pleaſed, for the unbelieving wife is ſanctified in and by the husband; and now alſo their children are not unclean, but holy. This of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, is ſuch a privilege, as is not common to all married folks, but peculiar to believing perſons, ſo that theſe may reap ſuch comfort and benefit hereby, that their unbelieving conſorts are ſanctified to or by themſelves; and they may have not only a lawful enjoyment, but alſo a holy uſe of their unbelieving yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows, for that God eſteems the ſeed of ſuch to be a holy ſeed, as truly as if both were believers. Thus the Apoſtle, his reſolution removes that ſcruple of Conſcience, telling them, the believing husband or wife, they were not defiled by remaining joyned with the unbelieving conſort, but rather that the unbelieving conſort was ſanctified in or by the believing husband &amp; wife: he which your ſenſe, of natural or Matrimonial chaſtity, or ſarcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:168478:73"/>(if you will have the word alſo) is nothing ſo ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to, or anſwerable for.</p>
                     <p>For (again) if ſo it ſhould be meant and underſtood, the Reaſon would have been as good, The unbelieving wife or husband is ſanctiſied by or in the unbelieving husband and wife; or the believing Conſort is ſanctified in and by an unbelieving Conſort; or the husband is ſanctified by the wife, and the wife by the husband, Let them be what they will, believers or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, according to your ſenſe, as betwixt whom there is your matrimonial Chaſtity, or lawful Marriage. But then it would not have been ſo true every way (as now it is according to my ſenſe) for <hi>to the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure, but even their minde and conſcience is defiled,</hi> Titus 1.15.</p>
                     <p>Nay more, whereas the believing Conſort ſanctifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Conſort, and not the other way, the unbelieving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort ſanctifieth the believing one, if matrimonial Chaſtity, or your natural Sanctity, were here underſtood, both Conſorts would here be ſanctified; yea both the believing one, and alſo the unbelieving one would be, and were hereby ſanctified in themſelves, not by, or in, one the other, for <hi>Marriage is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable amongſt all, and the bed undefiled,</hi> Heb. 13.4. And then you may alter the Text of <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſay, to the impure, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving husband or wife alſo, all things are pure 3. they are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified even in themſelves, by their matrimonial Sanctity, and natural Chaſtity, and even their minde and conſcience is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, what an incongruity and inconſiſtency is there in ſuch a reddition and interpretation, the unbelieving: wife is ſanctified by or in the believing husband; that is, chaſtified or matrimonially holy? Said I not but even now, That chaſtity amongſt the Heathen, or ſpoken of them, as here you will have it, of the unbelieving, is never called Sanctification, or San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, in Scripture? Turn down to your ſelf the one Text, and then turn it over to me. I gave you alſo reaſon for it, becauſe their bodies are not the Temples of the Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of Sanctification and Sanctity. But, I pray, ſhew me alſo, that one Conſort or yoke-fellow doth chaſtifie or make chaſte the other, like as the Apoſtle ſheweth you, that one doth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:168478:74"/>ſanctifie and make holy the other; and if ſo be both Conſorts be not chaſte, how are they made chaſte or chaſtified, each by, or in other; or if but one be unchaſte, how is he or ſhe chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or made chaſte, by or in the other chaſte one, be it he or ſhe?</p>
                     <p>Truly, Sir, this opinion of yours, and your ſenſe here, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a little to be chaſtiſed, till it be more ſenſible, yea and chaſtified too, as which doth adulterate and corrupt the purity of the Word, and the ſanctification of this Text. It may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing recreate the Reader (if any come to reade theſe ſheet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>) to interſert what a great Champion of Infant-Baptiſm hath related of as great an oppoſer of it, about the interpretation of this Text; which he holding, as you do, it to be meant of matrimonial chaſtity, and holineſs, bringeth forth as a parallel Text, the 34 Verſe of this Chapter. I pray look the Verſe, it is too longton me to write out twice; and he thus rendreth and meaneth it: The unmarried cares for the things of God, that ſhe may be holy in body and Spirit, <hi>i.e.</hi> That ſhe may be chaſte: but ſhe that is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, cares for the things of the world, that ſhe may pleaſe her husband. The Relator ſaith of it onely this, That in truth it is a pretty odd ſenſe, thus invented; and that which I onely ſhall adde, is, That if thus invented, it is (hardly) in truth; and though pretty, it is not chaſte, but holy, that the Apoſtle aimeth at, That ſhe being unmarried, and free from worldly cares, careth the more for the things of God, that ſhe may be godly and holy; and whether the ſenſe be even or odd, I paſs not; it is odd indeed, that the unmarried careth for the things of God, that ſhe may be chaſte. I will make it even, and ſay with the Apoſtle, The unmarried careth for the things of God, how ſhe may be holy.</p>
                     <p>If you ask me now for my ſenſe and interpretation of S. <hi>Paul</hi> here to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaying, The unbelieving Conſort is ſanctified by or to the believing Conſort, I gave it you but a little before, to be this plainly, You believing Conſorts may have, and have, if you dwell together, not onely a lawfull enjoyment, but a holy uſe of your unbelieving Conſort. This I ſhall elucidate, by comparing it with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. where <hi>the creature is ſaid to be ſanctified by the word and prayer,</hi> unto the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:168478:74"/>pure and Believer. You may as well limit and reſtrain the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification here, onely to a lawfull uſe of the Creatures to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and unbelievers, as you do the other former ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, onely to the lawfull marriage of the unbelievers and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: But as I have ſhewed you the one, ſo I ſhall now prove that the other holdeth out more to your eyes, if you will open them and look on, becauſe the Heathens and unbelievers had a lawfull uſe of the Creatures; but S. <hi>Paul</hi> here to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch an uſe of the Creatures, as they had not, and is appliable onely to Believers, and therefore is a holy and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied uſe alſo (not lawfull onely) as appears by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, for it is ſanctified by the Word and Prayer, they have the Word to Warrant the uſe of them, and Prayer to worke down Gods bleſſing upon them; and then alſo (in the fourth verſe) Thankſgiving, to ſend up glory to God for them; all which the Heathen and unbeliever were not capable of, or able to, and this Sanctification is not their lawfull uſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a peculiar holy uſe of them, which the Believers and Saints have.</p>
                     <p>And ſo this Expoſition of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> makes the other of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> clear and ſtronger; for ſome of your Sect hold, That the Sanctification of the unbeliever here in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> is ſuch a Sanctification as is parallel with that there in <hi>Timothy;</hi> and therefore I may infer, that as the ſanctification in <hi>Timothy,</hi> is peculiar onely to Believers, and more than a lawfull uſe of the Creatures, which Heathens are alſo capable of: ſo the Sanctification in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> is a holy uſe of the unbelieving Conſort unto the Believer, and more than a lawfull or Matrimonial Chaſtity, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers may and do enjoy amongſt themſelves.</p>
                     <p>This that I have ſet down, is the ſame in effect, with that which our latter Divines call Inſtrumental Sanct fication; they mean, and ſo would have the Apoſtle to mean, when he ſaith that the unbelieving Conſort is ſanctified by or to the believing Conſort, that is ſanctified inſtrumentally, to the precreating of iſſue or children, which the believing Conſort doth ſanctifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>; and ſo both together, the unbeliever ſanctified by or in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, do make a holy root, to produce a holy branch. For its evident, that this ſanctifying by the believing party here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:168478:75"/>reſpects the iſſue, as the Apoſtles reaſon ſheweth; elſe were your children unclean, but now they are holy. And you and your Sect acknowledge as much, by your grounding and building a legitimation of iſſue thereupon. Briefly, the Infidel party is ſanctified by and in the other, both for a holy Conjugal Society, and for raiſing up of a holy Seed unto God: ſo it is but relatively, for abſolutely all are ſanctified onely in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I ſhould and would have come to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Scruple, or Caſe of Conſcience, about their children; but that I remember a parcel or Clauſe of your third and laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, reſerved hither, becauſe it was clapt in there diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and impertinently; and it is this, as you deliver it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again, if it ware ment</hi> (were meant) <hi>otherwiſe, then might the unbelieving wife be ſaved, and enjoy any Church-privilege by the faith of the husband, or the husband by the faith of the wife, as well as the child by the faith of the Parents, and that by the Apoſtles rule in this Verſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it were meant otherwiſe; you mean (I ſuppoſe) if the being ſanctified of the unbelieving Conſort, by or to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving one, were not meant of your natural holineſs or clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or others Matrimonial Chaſtity and Sanctity (for I will give you in this, as an overplus) but of our, either the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers holy uſe of his unbelieving Conſort, or his unbelieving Conſorts being inſtrumentaly ſanctified to the procreation of children, together with the Believer. What then? then might the unbelieving wife be ſaved, and enjoy any Church-privilege by the faith of the husband, and the husband by the faith of the wife, as well as the child by the faith of the Parents. For the General, its a non-ſequence, and then a non-ſenſe. Once more I muſt tell you of your non-ſenſe, of natural holineſs or cleanneſs; you did well to joyn them together, otherwiſe, were it not for your cleanneſs, you were clean gone as to your holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and muſt go off uncleanly from your natural holineſs; for the Apoſtle never intended any of your natural holineſs or cleanneſs (nor the others Matrimonial) but either a Moral, or Ceremonial, or rather Inſtrumental, or Sacred-uſual (if I may ſo ſpeak.) And another non-ſenſe of yours is, your putting of Salvation, and enjoying of Church-privileges together, when
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:168478:75"/>as many are ſaved that enjoy none of them, and ſome enjoy many of them, and yet are not ſaved; yea, and putting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before enjoying of Church-privileges, when as ordinarily Church-privileges, and the enjoying them, go before ſaving and Salvation. Theſe things carry not ſenſe in them, beſides they are not according to the ſenſe of the Apoſtle and his Text, which ſpeak onely a word of ſanctifying, and not of ſaving a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable.</p>
                     <p>And now again, from being ſanctified, eſpecially the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving husband or wife's being ſanctified to their being ſaved, whileſt unbelieving is one of your greateſt non-ſequences you have made in your two ſheets, though you underſtand it of any of the ſanctifyings mentioned, mine or yours.</p>
                     <p>Once more, and laſtly, The unbelieving husband or wife, though ſanctified by and in the believing Conſort any of the waies, yet may not be ſaved and enjoy Church-privileges, as well as the born child of a believing Parent, becauſe this child hath preſent capable Right, and real Title to a Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, which is Baptiſm, and all other Privileges of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as he ſhall grow up to them, yea and to ſalvation it ſelf: whereas the unbelieving husband or wife hath not juſt plea in preſent to any of theſe, until forſaking their unbelief, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt, and make preofeſſion of their faith, and ſo come into Covenant with the believing Conſort, and its child or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Therefore I ſay, not ſo well as a Chriſtian child, may an unbelieving husband or wife be ſaved, or enjoy Church-privileges, by the faith of the believing Conſort; and you did not as well as you might to ſay ſo; eſpecially ſeeing children born of Chriſtian Parents, are not unbelievers or Infidels, but Believers rather, as I have formerly ſhewed; as alſo how, and in what way and ſenſe, ſuch children may be ſaid to enjoy Church-Privileges, and to be ſaved by the faith of their Parents; to which I refer the Reader, and your ſelf.</p>
                     <p>You write ſomething of the Apoſtles rule in this Verſe, by which it would follow, which you preſume of; but whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſt you apply it ill here, it begins to be your rule, and you being the Authour of the miſapplying, are alſo the Maſter of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule. I know no rule here, but the Propoſition and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtle, that the unbelieving wife is ſanctified by the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:168478:76"/>husband, and the unbelieving husband is ſanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d by the wife. The Apoſtle ſaith not, as you, is ſaved, or enjoyeth Church-privileges, by or in the believing Conſort, whileſt he is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer; and yet ſo it may fall out, that the unbelieving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort may be brought off from its infidelity by the believing Conſort, and ſo may enjoy all Church privileges, and in the end be ſaved; for ſo Verſe 16. <hi>What knoweſt thou, O wife, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt ſave thy husband?</hi> (he ſpeaks to the believing wife of her unbelieving husband,) <hi>Or how knoweſt thou, O man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt ſave thy wife?</hi> (ſo he ſpeaks alſo to the believing husband, of his unbelieving wife.) The which Text may be a ſatisfying reaſon for the comfortable and hopeful continuance of marriage-ſociety and cohabitation, as which doth fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe jealouſies that might ariſe in their minds from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Text, perhaps they knew of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.4. &amp; 3. ver.</p>
                     <p>I ſhut up the Point with this, That howſoever the juſt and righteous man ſhall live by his faith, yet as the Apoſtle ſaith, the unbelieving husband is ſanctified by his wife, and the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving wife by her husband (though it may be, not to life or ſalvation) this ſanctifying which the Apoſtle mentions of the unbelieving party, is a reſult of the faith of the believing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort; ſo the unbeliever is twice ſaid to be ſanctified, but not the Believer; and the Believer doth ſanctifie the unbeliever, or elſe I can make no ſenſe of the Apoſtles Argument.</p>
                     <p>And ſo now by a kinde of back skip, I ſhall return from your third Conſideration, where you ended about the unbelieving Conſorts ſanctification by the believing one, unto your firſt Conſideration; where you begin about their childrens being unclean or holy. Do you not ſee what a great deal of trouble your want of good order and method, your ignorance of our Univerſity Arts and Learning, doth create to me? Truly you might pitty me as much for the one, as I do you for the other.</p>
                     <p>For ſo the next Quaere or ſcruple of Conſcience in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Believers unto the Apoſtle, was, what they ſhould do about their children they had, or ſhould have begotten of their Infidel husbands or wives, whileſt they lived and remained in wedlock with theſe? and whether they ſhould look upon them their children, as any part of Gods people belonging to the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:168478:76"/>Church, and ſo what he thought of them? To which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle anſwereth, they were not unclean, but holy. But the words are not barely propounded as his Reſolution of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> ſecond Doubt or Quaere, but as an addition or proof unto their firſt Quaere or doubt, as the form and manner of the ſpeech ſheweth, <hi>Elſe were they unclean, but now they are holy.</hi> The like is, 1 Cor. 15.29 <hi>Elſe what ſhall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe not?</hi> So here, <hi>The unbelieving husband is ſanctified by his wife, &amp;c. elſe were your children unclean, but now they are holy.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, This farther proves that Sanctification, becauſe your children are holy, which elſe would be unclean. Thus the Apoſtle here, one of theſe Doubts or Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res neceſſarily flowing from another, as one ſore breaking out by another, by the reſolution of the ſecond, as it were a Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter laid upon it, both ſalveth that, and alſo ſpreads and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſame, to the more perfect cure of the firſt.</p>
                     <p>But I will give you the precedency of ſpeech, as who love to hear you ſpeak firſt; and it is (indeed) my place to be but an Anſwerer, and ſo to take into conſideration what you put to me. Say on therefore, and ſpeak out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider farther firſt, if this holineſs here ſpoken of, be a holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſanctification; ſuch as is the way to heaven and ſalvation, as ſome will affirm? then I pray let me ask you this queſtion, from whence this holineſs cometh?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What ſome will affirm, I know not, do you? then you know the future opinions of ſome as well (and indeed, as well) as the preſent minde of the Spirit in this Text. But its not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to my anſwering of you, what ſome men will affirm; let me hear what either they or you do affirm; or tell me the names of thoſe <hi>ſome,</hi> and then I ſhall tell whether they do affirm; but what they will affirm, I leave it to you to foretell, and from henceforth to begin to be a Prognoſticator or foreteller of weather; which you may be better, than of the wills of men.</p>
                     <p>Again, holineſs of ſanctification! <hi>Manhu,</hi> what is this? I do not think any will affirm it, beſides your ſelf, either to ſpeak ſuch words, being both one, not diſtinct things, holineſs being the quality or habit, and ſanctification being but the act and operation of the ſame; ſo that rather both you and they ſhould
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:168478:77"/>have ſaid, if you would ſpeak right Engliſh, or ſenſe, The ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of holineſs, than The holineſs of ſactification. But now farther, neither is holineſs of ſanctification here ſpoken of, as to the children in queſtion, and under doubt; for, becauſe you do not ſpeciſie whom you ſpeak of, and of whom you affirm or deny this your holineſs of ſanctification, let me, I pray, ask you this queſtion, Of whom, Parents or their children? ſure of the children, and their holineſs (for of the unbelieving Parents and their ſanctification, you have done ſpeaking; and your asking me whence this holineſs of ſanctification cometh? and your anſwering your ſelf, Either from the lawfulneſs of the marriage of their Parents, or from the faith of the Parents, or from the Covenant; theſe do make clear what you held in obſcurity, that the holineſs here ſpoken of to be a holineſs of ſanctification, ſuch as is the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Salvation, as ſome will affirm, no matter who, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by you to be, or at leaſt queſtioned, if not refuted, as to the being of it in the children of Parents, whereof one is an unbeliever.</p>
                     <p>And now I have another queſtion to ask you, Why you joyn together in the children onely (ſanctification of holineſs) when as the Apoſtle divided them betwixt the Parents and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, giving ſanctification to the Parents, the unbelieving wife or husband, is ſanctified by the believing Conſort, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving holineſs to their children; Elſe were they unclean, but now they are holy? And laſtly, (for I cannot forget how when time and place was, you wearied and tired me with your quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, I ask you another queſtion, If your conjunction (holineſs of ſanctification) be not a tautologie, or vain repetition? whether your limitation following (ſuch as is the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Salvation) be not a Battologie, or needleſs reſtriction? For is there any holineſs or ſanctification, which is not the way, or tending to Heaven and Salvation?</p>
                     <p>And now Sir, to your queſtion you ask me, From whence this holineſs (that is, of children) cometh? and as ſoon as you asked this queſtion, and before I could open my mouth to make you anſwer, from whence, away you are gone, to your ſuppoſitions, If it come from the marriage of the Parents, or if from their faith, or if from the Covenant: and who are you
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:168478:77"/>like to herein? I will not give you neither time or ſcope to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but without all ſuppoſition, ſhall ſay, you are like to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> who asked Chriſt this queſtion, What is Truth? and as ſoon as he had ſaid it, went out unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> as not having the patience to ſtay for the Anſwer, <hi>John</hi> 8.38. Whether <hi>Pilate</hi> were able to anſwer that queſtion himſelf, What is Truth, I know not, it ſeems you are, and therefore made ſuch haſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from me, to take my breath (as it were) out of my mouth, or rather to ſtop it, and to undertake the anſwer your ſelf; for preſently you follow on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If it cometh from the lawfulneſs of the marriage of the Parents, then why was not</hi> (were not) <hi>all the ſons and daughters of</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Rehoboam, Jeroboam, Nadab, <hi>and others of the kings of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>ſaved; ſeeing they were all lawfully married ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to there</hi> (their) <hi>Laws and Cuſtoms? and why are not drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,</hi> (drunkards) <hi>ſwarers,</hi> (ſwearers) <hi>and other prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſaved, whyle</hi> (while) <hi>they ſo lived and ſo died; ſeeing they are in our experience of tymes</hi> (times) <hi>the children of lawfull married people, according to the laws of the land? and why was</hi> Jeptah (Jephthah) <hi>ſaved, ſeeing he was a baſtard?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How now, Sir? is all the ado for this? I looked for Grapes from your mouth, and you bring forth wilde grapes; I looked for judgement, and behold oppreſſion, or a ſcab; and for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and behold a cry, or a lye. In a word, I looked for an anſwer, and behold more queſtions, and nothing but queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thoſe nothing to the purpoſe; for 1. whereas you ſaid before, Some will affirm, that ſanctification of holineſs in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſuch as is the way to heaven and ſalvation, is here ſpoken of, do you affirm if you can, of ſome that ſay, or ever ſaid, that it came from the lawfulneſs of the marriage of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Here you are like <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> who imagined wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills in the air before him, and ran a tilt at them: ſo you ſet up images and imaginations in your way, to queſtion them, thereby to keep your ſelf in breath, and your pen on paper. 2. Suppoſe ſome had affirmed it, that childrens ſanctification of holineſs (for as long as I am about your work, I ſhall uſe your words, and when I have done that, I ſhall leave there, for I like them not) cometh from the lawfulneſs of the marriage of their Parents, doth or may then rationally or religiouſly follow
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:168478:78"/>thereupon ſuch a queſtion, as, Why then were not all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of all married Parents in the Church? (for I paſs by your great reading in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and their Genealogies, ſo impertinent here;) and why not drunkards and ſwearers, which are in your experience of times the children of lawfull married people? (you ſeem to be a man of great experience of times, and a diligent obſerver of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens births, and their Parents marriages, and are a fit man to be the Regiſter of your Pariſh, and to keep the Book;) why, (ſay you) were they not all ſaved? and why was <hi>Jephthah</hi> ſaved, ſeeing he was a baſtard, and not the child of lawfully married Parents? what a conſequence, or rather, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a non-ſequence of a queſtion is here from a ſuppoſition? like unto this, the qualification of coldneſs in the water, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the confluence of ſhowers into the pond, why then are not all the drops and handfuls fetched thence, ſweet and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled? Sanctification of holineſs in the children, cometh from the lawfull marriage of their Parents, why then are not all their children and iſſues ſaved? Sirs, can you forbear ſmiling? They ſay, when one Almanack-maker looketh upon another, they ſmile both, to think how they delude ſimple people with their vain and falſe Prognoſtications; <hi>certes,</hi> when you Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſee one another, you cannot but laugh out, to remember how you deceive ſilly people with your irrational and inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent argumentations: <hi>offer it now unto thy Governour, thy God, will he be pleaſed with thee,</hi> and thy Queſtion, Why not all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? he will tell thee, that thy and their deſtruction is from themſelves; but thy and their help or ſalvation is in me, ſaith God; not in or from any other, Parent or not Parent, married or not married, lawfully or not lawfully, you and they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the free grace of God, and not by the ſanctification of holineſs in the one or other.</p>
                     <p>Yea, do you not anſwer your ſelf, why drunkards and ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who were children of lawfull married Parents, are not ſaved? Why they ſo lived, and ſo died drunkards and ſwearers, how could they?</p>
                     <p>But what is all this to our buſineſs, which is not of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſanctification? Here is another of your abſurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent queſtions; ſanctification of holineſs in children, if
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:168478:78"/>it come from the lawful marriage of the Parents, why then are not all ſanctified, ſo you ſhould have ſaid, &amp; would, if you could have told how to keep to the Queſtion: &amp; then you might have anſwered your ſelf, or needed not have made ſuch a queſtion, ſeeing even the wicked children born of lawful married Parents in the Church, are in a way, which I ſhall anon ſhew you, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and this their ſanctification is a way alſo, unto Heaven and Salvation, and all thoſe whom you name, were in this way, and I ſuppoſe you know, I ſhall not need to tell you, what fell out in the way, that they were not all or any of them ſaved. It is one of your groſſe miſtakes and Reaſonings, from every kinde of ſanctification of holineſs, to conclude, the ſalvation of ſouls, when as (to go no farther) the unbeliever is here ſaid to be ſanctified in and by the believing, and their children are ſaid to be holy, from whence who can infer their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? theſe arguings, are rattles for boyes to play with, not Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for men to bring forth.</p>
                     <p>But whats the buſineſs, why <hi>Jephthah</hi> is here named? It is confeſſed, He was ſaved, becauſe the Scripture beareth witneſs of it, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32. and alſo that he was a baſtard, <hi>Judges</hi> 11.1. But ſeeing he was a baſtard, you ask, why he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? why? to teach you, that baſe birth is no obſtacle to free Grace, nor hindreth the ſalvation of any believer: no more than lawful marriage of Parents, ſo much talked of, or rather, as you ſhould have ſpoken, the legitimate birth of children, doth further the ſalvation of an unbeliever.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time, this Example named by you and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, doth accuſe you of inconſiderateneſs in your Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; for we are both conſidering (as you will have it) of the ſanctification of holineſs in children, whoſe Parents are one of them an Infidel or unbeliever, and you come in with your <hi>Jephthah</hi> neither of whoſe Parents were unbelievers, (though ſinful in that act,) and ſo its impertinent, as not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming within the compaſſe of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> doubt and Quaere, or the Apoſtles anſwer and Argument; and ſo you are beſides the Matter, and out of the Cauſe and Caſe here queſtioned in, all your Queſtions, being nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>But now laſtly, tell me one thing, did you not once, but a while ago hold, the Apoſtles meaning here, of childrens being

How then can you, and with what conſtancy can you now here argue againſt the ſanctification of holineſs in children, as comming from the lawfulneſs of the marriage of the Parents, who before make legitimation of their birth, and nothing elſe to be their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs? and lawful marriage to be the unbelieving Parent his ſanctification? Thus uſual it is with God to confound the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of his truth, ſo as to contradict their own Tenets: for as they heard only, that he which perſecuted the Church in times paſt, now preacheth the faith which once he deſtroyed, <hi>Paul</hi> by name, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. So we may ſee now, that he which revileth the Church in times preſent, now deſtroyeth the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, his own errours, which once he preached and wrote; but I will not name him: and as they glorified God in <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo we may glorifie God in this, and ſay, Great is Truth and will prevall; vile is errour, and will fall.</p>

                     <p>Here it the ſame ſong again of the ſanctification of holineſs in children, only to another tune; the former was to the tune of the lawful marriage of their Parents, and this is to the tune of faith of the Parents, or at leaſt one of them. I have found or put the firſt ſong, out of tune, and I believe I ſhall do ſo to the ſecond ſong, eſpecially in reference to the conſort or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof.</p>
                     <p>Sanctification of holineſs in children, cometh not from the ſaith of Parents, neither of them, by way of conveyance cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality or application, as I have ſaid before: that is, the faith of the Parent apprehending Chriſt and his righteouſnes, and holineſs, doth not cauſe, convey or apply the ſame unto his or their child, thereby to juſtifie and ſanctifie it: ſo it muſt, if
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:168478:79"/>you will argue from it, the faith of the Parents or one of them, to the ſalvation of their child, and therefore all that follows, even your conſquences, are thus blaſted and blown away.</p>
                     <p>But yet there is a ſanctification of holineſs in children, that comes from the faith of the Parent, or either of them, by way of declaration, relation or impetration; that is, the faith of the parents, Covenanted with God and baptized into Chriſt, doth relatively, and declaratively ſanctifie their child, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame holy ſeal of the Covenant with themſelves; and may impetrate holineſs, and ſalvation for him, though not impart or derive the ſame to it, unleſs it be in a foederal way, which is a way alſo to ſalvation, like as if the root be holy, ſo are the branches. But all this may be, but without any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or infallible conſequence of ſalvation hereupon, though it is in the way, and a way thereto, as I ſaid.</p>
                     <p>I muſt here tell you again of the ſame fault, as I did before, that our Diſcourſe and Diſpute, is about childrens ſanctification of holineſs, and you ſtill run out, to childrens ſalvation of happineſs, whereas this doth not alwaies or neceſſarily, either Logically, or Theologically follow upon that. There needs no more or farther Conſideration of this Paragraph, but only of this, that inſtead of proceeding in Diſpute like an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick and Scholar, you conclude here like an Epidemick and vulgar, Taking away the ſubject of the queſtion, the holineſs of children from the faith of the Parents: for you give inſtances of <hi>Rahab</hi> a Heathen, whoſe Parents were Infidels; ſhe was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Grace of God, what is that, to her being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the faith of Parents: the like is to be thought and ſaid of thoſe firſt converts.</p>

                        <hi>If it be a federal holineſs, you deſire to know whether any of the ſeed of Abraham or David did enjoy any priviledge of the Church upon any ſuch account, without or before they had a commaund for it, ware they Circumciſed or did they eate the paſchal Lambe before they had a commaund for it?</hi>

                     <p>What! ſtill more rattling without reaſoning, and prattling without preſſing? I would you were as deſirous to know, as here you pretend, you would then ſoon know, that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know, is not a refuting of what others know, nor is your putting forth a Quaere, a putting down of our Anſwer, of the foederal holineſs of children. But what do you deſire to know, whether any of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>David</hi> did enjoy any privilege of the Church, upon any ſuch account, (of the Covenant you muſt mean) without, or before they had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it? yes, Sir, all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> did enjoy this holineſs, they were a holy ſeed, and people unto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Covenant of God made with them, and ſo were a peculiar people and privileged Church, before and without a command; as for your inſtance, which you bring for proof, were they Circumciſed, or did they eat the paſchal Lamb, be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168478:81"/>fore they had a Commaund for it? it is as pittiful a proof, as the inſtance is impertinent; for our diſcourſe is about holineſs from or under the Covenant, and your return upon it, is about Circumciſſion and the paſchal Lamb, the Seals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, from and under command; ſo according, to the proverb, whileſt we ask the queſtion of Onione, you make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Garlick, other impertinent inſtances: And the proof is as pittiful, for though we ſhould grant it, that none were Cir. cumciſed or did eat the Paſchal without or before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, yet were they holy, by vertue of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, without and before that Commandement, yea before and without their being Circumciſed, all the ſeven daies before they came under the Seal, they enjoyed that Church-privilege of holineſs, and were holy from the very Womb and birth; (and ſome alſo ſanctified in the Womb, yea, why not all there, ſaederally holy, being the ſeed of faithful Parents!) and ſo the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> (becauſe you mention it) the child that died the ſeventh day (and ſo a day before Circumeifion) enjoyed the ſame Church-privilege of holineſs, (from the Covenant) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>David</hi> could not nor would have ſaid, I ſhall go to it, declaring his hopeful aſſurance of its happineſs and being with God, from its birth-Covenant holineſs, knowing that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, or unholy thing can enter into Heaven, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23.</p>
                     <p>I deny not, but children of the Jews were holy alſo by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the Seal of the Covenant, which was commanded them; but they were holy too, before that, by the Covenant of Grace, which was promiſed them, and to argue from their ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or Sacramental holineſs, to the denial of their foederal or Covenantal holineſs, when as children have both holineſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But (it ſeems) you would have a command alſo for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens holineſs by Covenant: do you make ſo little account of Gods holy Covenant, as it children upon that account of their entrance, and being in Covenant with God, could not or ſhould not be accounted holy? is Gods Commandement only able to joy them of a Church-privilege, and to make them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, and not Gods Covenant, and Promiſe? when as the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:168478:81"/>Commandement of God, for the holy Seal to be annexed, is but a branch of the Promiſe or Covenant of God, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant goeth before the command, and is as a firſt ſtep or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner precedent of holineſs (as I may ſo ſay) unto children; The firſt holy Church-privilege, is the Promiſe and Covenant it ſelf, and the next, is the Seals of the Covenant; Holineſs is more intrinſical to the Covenant, and more extrinſical to the Seal, as manifeſting a diſcrimination, and difference of holy people from prophane and heatheniſh; ſo that children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, may be both waies holy, in their order and times, but primarily and principally holy by Covenant. I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeed, are the words and tenour of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Promiſe, and they ar eof force, and efficacy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, and make holy, both father and children, that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereinto: yea more (becauſe I am willing to give you full ſatisfaction in all your queres and quirkes) there is a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement alſo for childrens holineſs, in thoſe words (though they belong to a part of the Covenant interwoven with them) Thou ſhalt be my people, thou ſhalt be a holy Nation, a holy ſeed: whereupon the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. being to prove the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly privileges of the Church, and Nation of the Iſraelites, ſaith, that to them <hi>pertaineth the Adoption, the Covenants or Teſtament, the giving of the Law, the ſervice of God, and the Promiſes, and of whom as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came:</hi> all which and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Covenant and Promiſes, were ſanctifying Ordinances to the Parents and their ſeed.</p>
                     <p>But I haſten to an end, and will give over ſpending my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time about your nifles and trifles; only I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you, ſpeaking of children and their holineſs, how you joyn together, their being Circumciſed, and their eating the paſchal Lamb, and both by a Commandement. Take heed what you ſay, children of the Jews did they eat of the paſchal Lamb, by Commandement of God? I ſhall be ready to give you a fir caution, leſt you give occaſion to a foul notion. Firſt, therefore be ſure of your Commandement, to have it in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to ſhew; ſhew it now, and then it willb e in more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I have read over the whole inſtitution of the Paſſeover, and cannot finde a ſyllable of ſuch a command, for, nor a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of ſuch an example of, children eating of the paſchal
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:168478:82"/>Lamb: It may be you may finde ſome tuch thing au-ongſt the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and Doctors of the Synagogues, (but you, I ſuppofe, regard them as little, as you do our Students, and the learned of our Univerſities:) but is there any ſuch to be ſeen in the chair of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or to be read in the Pentateuch of his books? all that I can meet with is this, that (when their children ſhould ask their Parents the meaning of the Peſſeover) the Parents were to inſtruct or Catechiz: them therein, and ſo prepare them for a Paſſeover, againſt the time ſhould come, that they under, ſtood the ſervice thereof; in the mean, the memorial of the Angels paſſing over them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their paſſing over the Red Sea into the Wilderneſs, was ſo held up, even amongſt their children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.14.</p>
                     <p>Whats now become of your old Quaere now, what expreſſe command have you for ſuch and ſuch, (I retort it upon your ſelf,) for childrens eating the paſchal Lamb? Every Male-child ſhall be Circumciſed, a command is expreſſe for the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of children: <hi>Deus.</hi> 16.16. and ſure if chidlren had been to eat of the paſchal Lamb, there would have been as expreſſe a command for this; and whereas <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 23. <hi>Thrice in the year, ſhall all your men children appear before the Lord God,</hi> the place which he ſhall chooſe, whereof one time was, the feaſt of the Paſſeover; its granted, as a Commandement, that ſuch children, who could hold the father by the hand, and walk with him up to the Temple, went along with him; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? namely to be inſtructed, Catechized and bleſſed of the Prieſt, but not to eat of the paſchal Lamb, unleſſ: they were of that groweth in years, and in underſtanding of the myſtery: if otherwiſe, they had other food than the paſchal Lamb, for them of leſſer age and knowledge, as alſo for the unclean (as ſome might happen to be) and uncircyncumciſed, both at home, (when they did eat the Paſſeover,) and alſo at the Temple; as for the unleavened bread, I ſuppoſe the children did eat of that, becauſe for ſeven daies together all leavened bread was to be put quite and utterly out of the houſe, and burnt, inſomuch as they muſt not look upon any, yea, it was under Gods curſe, if any did eat any leavened bread, during thoſe ſeven daies (which at other times, ordinarily they did:) but for the paſchal Lamb, which was to be eaten up all in that one night, and what
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:168478:82"/>remained of it, to be burnt with fire in the morning. I take it, the children of the <hi>Jews</hi> did eat nothing of it at all, who were there, fore had to bed, and laid to ſleep, whileſt the Parents were ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating their evening, and night-ſervice of the Paſſeover. At other Sacrifices and Offerings, which were not Sacramental, its expreſſed, it ſhall be for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, for the Prieſt and his children, as being a part of their maintenance.</p>
                     <p>Now this I the rather enlarge upon, to perſwade you from your opinion that you have taken up, I know not where, (yes, I believe I know where you have taken it up, even where it lay, in-Tombed) that ſo you may be no occaſion of reviving and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up and old bruied error, that hath lain quiet in its grave theſe thouſand years and upwards; and that is, The adminiſtraing the Lords Supper unto Infants and children of Chriftians, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and decent.</p>
                     <p>This opinion was of force in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in the daies of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt (I will not name ſome others of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and reverend remembrance in that Age, who held the ſame thing and practice; and did thereby ſhew, that men ſtanding too much upon their own conceited interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may fall from the truth, and erre from the faith in ſome particulars; as you, Sir, have generally done throughtout your whole Letter;) for then He, and the reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church under him, believed that Infants baptized could not be ſaved, except they ſhould participate of the Euchariſt; taking their ground from that Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 6 53. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you;</hi> and therefore they held it the Lords Supper, wherein the flaſh of the Son of man is eaten, and his blood drunk, neceſſary to the life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Infants. But this was not the right interpretation of that Text, as which is not meant of that Euchariſtical or Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal feaſting upon Chriſts Body and Blood, but of a Spiritual Faith, and believing in Chriſts Death and Paſſion. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this opinion of Pope <hi>innocent</hi> the firſt, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church under him, is ſince retracted and rejected by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church under him, in that Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (whoſe Decrees are all held and canoniſed, to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>[How ſay you to this, you Great Patrons and Imitators of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſay ſhe cannot erre, at leaſtwiſe hath not erred? Did the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not erre in the daies of Pope <hi>Innocent?</hi> then is ſhe now in an error; doth ſhe not now erre herein? then did ſhe formerly erre, and conſeq tently may erre hereafter.]</p>
                     <p>But now, if thoſe above named had light upon your Tenet or error (as I think it) and could have made it hold up, which you onely raiſe and ſtartle (having the Gift, as any giſted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ever I read, to prove nothing, and affirm any thing) That the Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> did eat of the Paſchal Lamb and Supper, they would have had a far fairer pretext, and faſter ground, for the Infants of Chriſtians to participate of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical Cup and Bread of the Lords Supper; for then they would have pleaded hard for a Commandement of Chriſtian Infants to partake of the Euchariſtical Supper, even in or out of that Commandement you mention, but ſhew not, of the Jewiſh Infants to partake of the Paſchal Supper; and preſſed it the rather, for that the Euchariſtical Supper ſucceeds in place under the Goſpel, unto the Paſchal Supper under the Law; and rather more, for that the Grace of Chriſt now exhibited, is of larger extent, and greater latitude, than when he was to come and be revealed. And I tell you, theſe reaſons would have troubled much theſe Tridentine Fathers to have anſwered and refelled, more than that Text of <hi>John</hi> above cited.</p>
                     <p>But I believe, that you never had any ſuch notion or dream in your head, either ſleeping or waking; nay upon a re-view of your words, I ſee I may anſwer to your Queſtion, and ſay as you mean, and you never the nearer to what you aimed at; for you ſay thus, Did they eat the Paſchal Lamb before they had a Commandent? I anſwer, They did not eat the Paſchal Lamb before they had a Commandement; you mean ſo, do you not? and ſo do I, and what then? therefore the Jewiſh children had a Commandement to eat the Paſchal Lamb. But this followeth not well, nor will, before you follow this better.</p>
                     <p>But ſome others, whoſe opinion I rather think you follow, than they yours, they drive it on to another deſign, as thus,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:168478:83"/>Becauſe the Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> did eat the Paſſeover, as well as they were circumciſed, Therefore the Infants of Chriſtians ſhould eat and drink the Lords Supper as well as be baptized. This ſtructure is ſoon pulled down, ſtanding upon a falſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, even as the houſe fell, built upon the ſlippery ſand; and therefore I ſhall but touch it, and it ſinks or ſlides. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> did not eat the Paſſeover, but were onely circumciſed, Therefore the Infants of Chriſtians are not to eat and drink the Lords Supper, but onely be baptized.</p>
                     <p>So taking off the Argument againſt Infant-Baptiſm, from its falſe and ruinous foundation, of the Jewiſh children eating the Paſchal Lamb, you were beſt ſet it upon its own proper Baſis and build Baptiſm upon the Lords Supper thus, or rather pul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> it down by the Lords Supper, thus: If Infants of Chriſtians may be partakers of Baptiſm, then alſo they may be partakers of the Lords Supper; for why of one Seal of the Covenant, more than another? and if Infants may not be partakers of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, why then not of Baptiſm, no more of one Seal than the other; beſides they are capable of the ſpiritual part of the one Sacrament, as well as the other. So I have made the Argument as ſtrong for you as I can; if you can fort fie it yet more, do it quickly, for I am in haſte to anſwer, as deſirous to make an end of theſe weariſom skirmiſhes, as to my ſelf, and tedious diſcourſes, as to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>What! will you become of Antipaedobaptiſts, now Propae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docoeniſts, and grant Infants ſometimes, and ſometimes deny them in Argument the Lords Supper, that you may deprive the of the Lords Baptiſm?

                     <p n="1">1. Your own Reaſon and Anſwer will do it, that from the one Seal ordered and appointed for Infants, to another Seal not enjoyned or inſtituted for Infants, the Conſequence is vain and invalid; the former I have largely proved, and diſproved the latter clearly; let but the Argument reſt till can can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet or diſturbe it, and I deſire no more.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From Baptiſm, which is the Seal Initial, and of Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion due to Infants, to infer the Lords Supper, which is the Seal Progreſſional, and of nouriſhment, to be alſo due in preſent,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:168478:84"/>and partaked of in infancy (like as the other) is as inconſequent an abſurdity, as to infer time to come from preſent, or perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from beginning, or a man from a child, and to joyn them in one moment, ſtate and age. Can a man enter into his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, and be born a babe again? or as ſoon as he is born a babe, can he run over the ages, and become a man preſently? <hi>When I a child,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I ſpake as a child, and underſtood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childiſh things.</hi> I mean, Infants may be ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated by the Seal of Baptiſm into the Church, and are fitted to have the Graces and Benefies of the Covenant ſealed unto them, but that they are preſently perfitted to have the nouriſhment and growth of the ſame Graces ſealed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto them, by the Lords Supper, paſſeth mine, and your, as much as their capacity.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that both Baptiſm and the Lords Supper do ſeal the ſame, and the whole Covenant and the Graces of the ſame, but both in their place, order, and time, ſo as the prime and main uſe of Baptiſm is to be the Seal of Initiation and Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Covenant, and the Lords Supper is the Seal of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Confirmation of the ſame, as to the main and prime uſe of it: ſo as that Baptiſm ſeals the Infants entrance and admiſſion thereinto, which the Lords Supper doth not properly and principally, but onely by way of ſuppoſition and teſtification of a ſpiritual life and entrance, (ſuch doth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual food of the Lords Supper imply and require aforehand:) So alſo, as that the Lords Supper ſeals the growth and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame Graces of the Covenant, which Baptiſm doth not properly and primarily, but onely by way of infuſion of a ſeed, or laying a foundation of ſuch growth and nouriſhment (ſuch doth the ſpiritual life of Baptiſm tend and proceed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.)</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Though Infanrs may and ought to be partakers of Baptiſm, yet may they not, nor ought to be partakers of the Lords Supper in their infancy, becauſe the Lords Supper belongs onely to ſuch, as can ſpiritually examine themſelves, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Lords Body, as the Apoſtle expreſly and directly ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 28, 29. whereas Baptiſm belongs unto Infants of Chriſtians by right of their being in the holy Covenant of God,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:168478:84"/>and birth of baptized Parents; for more is required to the Lords Supper, than unto Baptiſm, of Church-members by nature and birth: whereas of Aliens and Strangers, more is required of them unto Baptiſm, than of Church-members unto the Lords Supper; a publick profeſſion of faith is neceſſary for the admitting of a Heathen into the viſible Catholick Church by Baptiſm, and his entring into the Goſpel-Covenant for himſelf and his Seed, and he may preſently after be partaker of the Lords Supper, upon the examination of his faith, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But Infants, being in Church-Covenant by birth, have a juſt Title and Right to all the external Privileges in the Church (as being free-born to them all) in due time and order, as to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in their infancy, becauſe born members of the Church, ſo to the Lords Supper, when by reaſon of full age and uſe they have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil; and this their Covenant-right remains until it be forfeited by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of Baptiſm on their part, or by excommunication from the other, the Lords Supper, by the Churches power, when they are either wilfull violaters of the Conditions of the Covenant, or hate to be reformed by wholſom Cenſures.</p>
                     <p>If any farther reply (He muſt be a better replyer than you) That the Infant baptized can no more diſcern the Lords Body and Blood in Baptiſm, than in the Supper, nor the ſign it ſelf in the act of Adminiſtration of either Sacrament, and therefore Baptiſm is as vainly given it as the Lords Supper. I re-joyn, That our Infants can and do as well diſcern the Sacramental Sign, and the thing ſignified in Baptiſm, as well as the Jewiſh Infants did diſcern the ſame in Circumciſion. So that if our Baptiſm be in vain to ours, their Circumciſion was alſo in vain to their Children; and the Replyer doth but open his mouth againſt Heaven, and chargeth God himſelf with vanity and folly, for appointing Circumciſion of Infants (and alſo Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants) whereas the Axiom is, God and Nature doth nothing in vain, or fooliſhly. As therefore the Jewiſh Infants were to have the initial Seal of Circumciſion, the old Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imprinted upon them in their infancy, to ſeal up the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto them, under which they were born, though they had no ſuch diſcerning, as is now required of the Replier to be in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:168478:85"/>the preſent act of our new Miniſtration: ſo our Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are to have the initial Seal of Baptiſm, the new Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſprinkled upon them In their infancy, to ſeal up the ſame Covenant unto them, under which they are born, though they have no more diſcerning, than was mentioned to be in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Infants then at the paſt act of their old Miniſtration.</p>
                     <p>And yet neither of theſe Ordinances vain or ineffectual to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Infant parties. For the efficacy of Baptiſm (as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion) depends not upon the act of the Creature diſcerning and working, (this is but a rank Romance, or a Roman prank of the Replier,) but upon the free Grace and mercy of God conveighing and operating; yea Baptiſm is not onely a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient act, as to ſprinkling of water and outward waſhing, but a permanent and continued act of the ſame grace and mercy, as to the inward waſhing, and application of Chirſts merits unto all Gods children.</p>
                     <p>But Jewiſh infants diſcerned ſomewhat, as who had a bodily ſeeling of the cutting of their the foreskin of their fleſh; and ſo have our Chriſtian infants, a bodily feeling of the water laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their forehead or faces; but what's either to the purpoſe of the ſpiritual diſcerning of either action, or ſign as Sacramental to them? they diſcern ſomewhat, and this ſomewhat is nothing, nothing to the purpoſe, being but a natural feeling of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the water, or ſharpneſs of the knife.</p>
                     <p>But there is mroe reaſon, there ſhould be demanded, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of the ſign when Baptiſm is miniſtred, than there was when Circumciſion was given, for this left a mark or print of it ſelf behinde it, ſo that the Circumciſed perſon, <hi>bare in his body the mark of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> (to uſe the Apoſtles phraſe,) and he did daily diſcern that viſible ſign to aſſure him, that he was ſealed into Covenant with God; but the water leaves no impreſſion upon Baptized infants, but is either preſently wiped off with a Handkercheif by the Midwife, or other woman (though I think they ſhould not do ſo, and the Miniſters ought to rebuke them for it,) or ſhortly after it is dried up of it ſelf, ſo that the body is as if it were not waſhed or wetted at all, and and no mark to be ſeen outwardly to put the party in minde of his being ſealed into God his peculiar Servant.</p>
                     <p>But what, and if there be a mark and character, of Baptiſm,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:168478:85"/>like as of Circumciſion then there is no more reaſon of diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the one party, than the other.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean, that mark which Papiſts hold, is formed in the ſoul of every Baptized infant, and inſcribed thereby the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal action of Baptiſm, Simply and barely in it ſelf conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which they call an Indelible character: For ſuch is not to be found in Scriptures nor Orthodox writers; ſuch a chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, as may be imprinted and conſiſt without grace, in a ſoul damned; and beſides its abſurd, if not impious to aſcribe to an external action of a creature, that which is the proper act of God, an internal characteriſing, or indelible marking in the ſoul; and they may as well ſay, the bare and naked external preaching of the Goſpel or remiſſion of ſins, doth imprint eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation upon the ſoul without perceiving any force, or uſing any faith.</p>
                     <p>But I mean that mark and character, which the Ancient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox held to be imprinted in Baptiſm, which was either that gracious act, or gift never to he reiterated, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an indelible character: for a man rightly baptized, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Turk or Jew, and afterwards returning to the faith and Church of Chriſt, is in no caſe to be re-baptized, the vertue of his former Baptiſm is not ſpunged out, but ſtill remainech a vailable: (of which matter I have ſpoke largely before) or elſe the very grace and gife of the holy ſpirit, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the ſpirit in our hearts,</hi> and Eph. 1.13. <hi>In whom, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe;</hi> which alſo may very truly be called, an indelible ſeal and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, whereſoever it is inſcribed and imprinted, as it is in the hearts, and ſouls of many Baptized infants, even all belonging to the eternal election, and inheritance mentioned, and ſpoken of in the Texts above alleged.</p>
                     <p>Or thirdly, the character of Baptiſm is that paſſive power, whereby the party Baptized is made fit and capable, in due time and order to receive the other Sacrament, the Lords Supper; whereof without Baptiſm he were uncapable, as without Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion the Jew was of the Paſſeover.</p>
                     <p>So then there is in both the initial ſeal, marks or characters; and as much mark, left upon the face and forehead of the infant
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:168478:86"/>Baptized, as there was upon your head and face, when you were dopt, or dipt over both, in the Pond or River you wote off; and though the outward mark were more permanent in Circumciſion, being done and engraven upon, and into the fleſh by inciſion, yet there was an outward mark in Baptiſm (though more tranſient.) done, and laid upon the face, and fleſh by aſperſion or infuſion, as anciently by immerſion,</p>
                     <p>But neither was the one character or mark more diſcernable to the one, the Circumciſed infant, then the other to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized infant: neither if it was, was it more available to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Paſſeover, then the other to the partaking of the Lords Supper; or more acceptable to God, who though he ſet ſometimes an outward mark upon them that mourned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. and ſo and outward mark upon the houſes of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> for good ends and purpoſes, and ſo appointed the external elements and actions both of Circumciſion, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be holy, and profitable ſignes and ſeals, yet are not the outward marks in the fleſh, or the ſenſitive diſcernings of the ſings, the excellencies of Circumſion, or the eminencies of Baptiſm; nor is God taken onely, or chiefly delighted with beholding ſuch external ſervices and adminiſtrations; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired theſe at your hands, theſe onely or chiefly? when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jewiſh infants came to years of diſcretion and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; God looked for and called for, not the Circumciſion of the fleſh, but for the Circumciſion of the heart; this was the mark he looked for, and upon in his ſheep, the Iſraelites: and and ſo likewiſe, when Chriſtian infants ſhall attain to the age of diſcerning and underſtanding, God will look for and upon, not ſo much the water in or upon the face, which was the mark of fleſh, as the blood of Chriſt in the heart, which is the mark of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And this is that I conclude with; As one of your Baptized, and re-baptized adult proſelytes, may have the ſign of water, and diſcern the ſign in the very act with the eye of his fleſh, and yet be a groſſe heritique, and a vile hypocrite, yea a very reprobate; So an infant may be, and but once Baptized, and that in its infancy, and want your diſcerning of the ſign, and yet when he comes to years of diſcretion, prove a holy, pious, honeſt, orthodox and worthy Chriſtian.</p>

                     <p>But now that, according to our agreement, you and others have ſpoken firſt, all you had, and have to ſay for your legitimal holineſs to be here meant, againſt the federal holineſs of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſtians Baptized: (which all, is but very little, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nothing,) it is my turn now to ſay ſomething for our fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holineſs to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I ſay then, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the children of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, of whom one is a believer the other an infidel, and ſaying that they are not unclean but holy, doth not mean, holineſs by legitimation, as thus, your children are not baſtards, but law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten and born, as you, and other of the ſeparation do expound it, inſiſting in the ſteps of the Jeſuites, and in the way of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which and whom, notwithſtanding you pretend a ſeperation as much, yea have taken a ſolemn Covenant for the extirpating of Popery. It is true ſuch a holineſs is here ſpoken of, and meant as is oppoſite to uncleanneſs, but to what uncleanneſs? the uncleanneſs of Idolatry, and Paganiſm, (for ſo theſe are called in Scripture phraſe, uncleanneſs and even ſpiritual Adultery and Fornication, and all Idolaters and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens are called harlots, and ſaid to go a Whoring after other gods) but you and your genuine Expoſitors, oppoſe that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to anothers uncleanneſs, onely which is bodily adultery, fornication and uncleanneſs, and ſo give us, as the genuine ſenſe of thoſe words, elſe were your children unclean, that is baſtards, but now they are holy, lawfully born, and no ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards; a genuine ſenſe indeed as you call, and according to the luſt of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If this had been all the matter, the <hi>Corinthian</hi> couples, know this particular better than the Apoſtle himſelf, who knew more than they all, of this matter of holineſs; they needed not to have ſent to him for his opinion and reſolution, to know whether their children were baſtards or no, who knew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being of the civil Heathens, to be lawfully married ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws and Cuſtoms of their Nations, and ſo their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:168478:87"/>iſſue to be legitimate; they were ſo fully aſſured of that and this, that they could have made evidence, and given ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Apoſtle, rather, then needed to have the one, or take the other from him.</p>
                     <p>And whereas its held of you, and all of us, that the Apoſtle here anſwereth a ſcruple or caſe of Conſcience, which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving party, joyned with an unbelieving yoke-fellow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto him, (as before about their conjugal ſociety, ſo) about their natal or natural iſſue, whether it was to be counted to the people of God, after the believing party, or as alien from God, after the unbelieving party; he anſwereth it clearly and pertinently, their children were not unclean, but holy, by which if he had meant, they are not baſtards, but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimates; the incomparably learned and Logical Diſputer, St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not anſwered to the buſineſs, and queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded (for they made no queſtion of the legitimacy of their iſſue, but of the holineſs of their ſtate) and the exquiſitely pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and Theological diſcerner, had very meanly reſolved their doubt, and but very cloudily elucidated their ſcruple, and afforded no peace as all to their Conſciences in this, but rather involved them in farther troubles. For the whole City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and all the Heathen Regions, and conjugal couples emongſt them, would have been diſturbed, and diſquieted in their Conſciences, at this caſe of Conſcience ſo reſolved by the Apoſtle, and would have been filled with confuſion, ready to have laid hands on <hi>Paul,</hi> where they could meet him, and to ſay of him, This is he that hath turned the world up-ſide-down, and is come hither alſo to be a ſetter forth of ſtrange reſolves and doctrines; yea to take and apprehnd him, and bring him unto <hi>Areopagus,</hi> the greateſt Court of the Heathens, for calling them all Whores and Adulterers, and their children baſtards and illegitimates, by this his reſolution, if it were according to your interpretation.</p>
                     <p>Look to it, Sir, for you are in danger to be called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this daies uproare, and this trouble of Conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the poor Heathen, there being no cauſe whereby you can give an account of this con-courſe and rugged interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, (obſerve it I pray) if the Apoſtle ſaying, the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving wife is ſanctified by the husband, and the unbelieving
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:168478:87"/>husband be ſanctified by the wiſe, elſe were their children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, did mean, elſe were they baſtards, according to your interpretation; doth not he, or rather do not you make him, call all thoſe children baſtards, whoſe both Parents were or are unbelievers? it is palpable, you do; for if the unbelieving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were not ſanctified by the believing, then were they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, that is, baſtards you ſay; and in ſo ſaying, you ſay thus much, That all children of thoſe Parents, whereof the one is not ſanctified by the other, are unclean, that is, baſtards; for the former propoſition being conditional and hypothetical, were not true, if this propoſition, which is pofitive, and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical were not true: or more plainly, I will reſolve the truth of the Apoſtles ſequel, (the unbelieving husband is ſanctified by the wife, &amp;c. elſe were your children unclean:) into this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, from which it floweth, namely, All the children of an unbeliever are unclean, unleſs the unbelieving husband be ſanctified by a believing wife, or the unbelieving wife be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a believing husband, for generation and coition, as I have ſaid: Now give you the ſenſe, and bring in your interpretation of it. All the children of an unbeliever are baſtards, unleſſe the unbelieving husband be ſanctified by a believing wife, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing wife be ſanctified by a believing huſband, for generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and coition: and then tell me whether you do not make the Apoſtle ſay, or rather ſay your ſelf, that all the children of the Heathen and unbelieving Parents, of which the one is not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the other believing are baſtards, notwithſtanding born of both Parents in lawful wedlock according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of Nations.</p>
                     <p>If the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had preached this doctrine, that you by your Expoſition would ſeem to make him, he would have been in many more perils and hazards, whileſt he paſſed through the Pagan and Heathen Nations, than he was, and would not have converted ſo many of them as he did; and I would wiſh you to be very wary, when you go over to the Savages in <hi>New England,</hi> and the Pagans in our <hi>Weſt Indes,</hi> that you broach not this either doctrine or interpretation, amongſt them, leſt the Parents there and husbands, and eſpecially the mothers and wifes fly in your face, and all to ſcratch you and ſcald you, for calling and making their children baſtards; and left the

                     <p>For I ſuppoſe you will not deny, but the minde of the Spirit was in <hi>Paul;</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> was of this minde, you muſt confeſſe it, That children of, though but one Chriſtian Parent, were holy, in the Scripture phraſe, in the Spirits language, in the Churchs relation: and if they be judged and reputed ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, and ſpoken of as ſuch by <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſhall not hereafter much minde or regard, what they are in your or others mindes and meanings, expoſitions and interpretations. For if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle reputeth them ſo, then God reputeth them ſo: in ſome things the Apoſtle ſaid, I, but not the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. in other, not I, but the Lord, 12 ver. but in this, I, and the Lord, for not I, (ſaith he) <hi>i.e.</hi>) I, onely, but the Lord alſo, verſe 14. the believing wife is ſanctified by the husband, &amp;c. elſe were your children unclean, but now they are holy: I ſaid before, that ſuch holineſs is here meant and ſpoken of, as is oppoſite to uncleanneſs, as appears in the very words, placed and ſet in oppoſition, one to the other, (elſe they were unclean, but now they are holy:) but to what uncelanneſs? not to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs of baſtardy, as you will have it, to make up a holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs onely of legitimation, both which I have refelled: but
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:168478:89"/>the uncleanneſs of infidelity, or a ſtate out of Covenant, as our Divines will have it, to make up the holineſs of theſe children, a holineſs of federation, or federal holineſs.</p>
                     <p>For ſo this ſtate out of Covenant, as Infidelity and Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm and Idolatry, is very often ſtiled and called uncleanneſs, as I touched before, and ſuch Infidel and Idolatrous Parents or people, are even named Adulterers and Fornicators, and ſaid to go a Whoring after ſtrange gods or Idols, and ſo its the condition, and denomination of their children to be called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, all after a Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>But you cannot ſhew me, where by unclean are meant ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, though baſtards may be called unclean; for where the unclean perſons are reckoned up, baſtards are not mentioned: But if this muſt go for an Expoſition of the Text, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the minde of the Spirit, as thus, unclean, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, then the terms or words muſt go or run true, both waies, backward and forward, that baſtards are unclean, and the unclean are baſtards. And whereas baſtards amongſt the Jews might not, by their Laws bear any Office in Magiſtracy ordinarily: (for <hi>Jephthah</hi> was extraordinarily choſen, by God and the people for this valour) nor ſit in the Sanctuary, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute any Prieſtly Office, as over the Congregation of the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.7. (like as by the Civil Laws, they could not enjoy Inheritances,) yet they were Circumciſed, and might eat the Paſſeover, and had free acceſſe to the Temple, and Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to perform worſhip and hear the Law, and were federally holy, as any legitimates.</p>
                     <p>But for the particular of infants holineſs, I ſay, 1. in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Any perſon, or family (for ſo it was at firſt, in <hi>Abraham</hi>) or Nation (as afterwards it was with the Jews, and is now with the Gentiles) that are in Covenant with God, and enjoy the Ordinances of his grace and mercy, do alſo, by vertue of Gods Promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed,</hi> convey to their iſſue and poſterity, a ſtate and privilege, (and ſo rather, it is the joynt Covenant made by God with both together, the Parent, and his iſſue and poſterity,) to be reputed of a holy, and clean ſociety and Congregation before God, from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pagan and heatheniſh world, and ſo the child or children born of ſuch Parents in Covenant, to be truly holy, like as the Parent, becauſe of the Covenant.</p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:168478:89"/>
                     <p>Not that inſants have any real perſonal qualitative holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, (which is and muſt be in all true believers, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parents or children, to make them acceptable to God, as to juſtification and Salvation) whom I confeſs, though born within the Church, and of believing Parents, to be born in ſin, naturally, and be unclean, children of wrath by nature, as well as others, the children of Pagans, without the Church. But I ſay, they have a federal and parental, (ſo it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a ſavory mouth) and relative or imputative holineſs, put upon them by the Covenant of God, and brought forth or executed on them, by, or at their birth of believing Parents, which is ſufficient and enough to make them paſſe in the eyes of God, and in the face of the viſible Church, for clean and holy; or if not, their profeſſions of the faith of Chriſt (for you will not deny them to be profeſſors of Chriſt, and members of the Church in part and in kinde, at leaſtwiſe) by the mouth of their Sureties preſenting them, and ſpeaking for them, this will bear them out, to be holy likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>And what if, I ſhould tell you in your ear, that Chriſtian infants in Covenant with God, are holy too, by an inward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs alſo, (are not all inward ſanctifying graces, effects of Gods Covenant, and who knoweth when God, as where, he effects them?) you, perhaps, would ſtop that ear, cry out. <q>Then grace, which onely maketh holy, cometh ſucceſſively and is derived by nature, and Parents ſhall be the authors, and conveighers of grace and holineſs to their children.</q> No ſuch matter, Sir, For the children are primitively holy with the Parents by the Covenant, as co-partners and confederates with them therein; (I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeed) not derivatively holy from the Parents, as ſolely or firſt partners and prefederates without theſe: Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children are both, joynt confederates, I ſay, and do both draw and derive together their holineſs, as other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, from the Covenant and Tenour of grace therein, and not ſucceſſively from one another, children from Parents deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively, as you fondly fanſie to your ſelf, and erroniouſly imagine. The which truth may alſo ſerve much, to clear off thoſe cloudy difficulties, ſo much preſſed by the <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> party, from the <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> ſide, about infants being Baptized,

                     <p>You, like enough before you will believe any holineſs in them, would have them ſhew ſome ſuch thing, either in words before they can ſpeak, and whileſt they are infants, that is, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; or indeed, before they have any idoneity of inſtruments and ability to act. (Have patience a while, and you may hear them ſpeak the words, and ſee them do ſome acts of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.) What! are you ſo ſenſual, all for ſenſe, and ſo altogether lead by ſenſe, that nothing, but a ſenſative or ſenſible manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holineſs in children will be believed by you? I had thought, you had walked by faith, and not by ſight; you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a holineſs, in other things, in Faith, in the Word, in the Sacraments, in the Church of God, and in all things, which the holy Scriptures, the oracles of holineſs, have pronounced holy, though you have not a viſible and ſenſible demonſtration of holineſs in them (you walk by faith there and not by fight) and why cannot you believe a holineſs, in children of Chriſtian Parents in Covernant with God, though they ſhew forth no ſenſible effects of ſuch holineſs, ſeeing alſo the ſame holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth call them holy, and not unclean, and ſo ſupplying their defect of ſpeech and action, giveth you what you ask, even a ſenſible manifeſtation of their holineſs, and ſpeaks them holy unto your ears, not declares them holy to your eyes, (ſo you may now walk by ſight, and hear ſay, not by faith and hope, limping and halting therein, for except you ſhall ſee in their hands, and tongues, the prints of holineſs in works, and words, and (perhaps) thruſt your fingers into their fides, to feel the holineſs of their hearts too, in affections and thoughts, you will not believe.</p>
                     <p>What and if our Saviour Chriſt ſhould now, as once, take one of our little children in Covenant with him, and ſet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and ſay, <hi>whoſoever humbleth himſelf as a little child, the ſame is greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> would it not be ſtrange for you, to tell him, you ſee no ſuch (yet you hear of ſuch) humility, lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, meakneſs, mildneſs, innocency, in children: and is it not a like, to tell him, you ſee no ſuch holineſs here, when you hear of it, from the mouth of Chriſt, his and this Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:168478:90"/>here ſaying, <hi>They are holy;</hi> But that I have ſaid it before and already, I would ſay, that even children ſhew themſelves more bumble, lowly, meek, mild, and innocent, and ſo more holy, than a great many of your grown Profeſſors, and grand Pretenders unto holineſs and all thoſe graces; let their holineſs and other graces reſt but a while, as ſeed hidden up in their hearts, or wrapped up in Gods Covenant with them, and ſee, if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they do not ſhew it, and their holineſs break not forth as the light at noon day, that was within the cloud, or as the ſeed in harveſt, that was within the clod; and in the mean time, <hi>ſhew me thy faith by thy works,</hi> and thy holineſs, by thy words; and learn to ſpeak better of childrens holineſs, and to do better with children for their holineſs, even ſo well, as to let them be Baptized.</p>
                     <p>But beſides this in hand, there are two eminent Texts, that hold out infants of Chriſtians, their holineſs by Covenant: the one is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>If the firſt fruit be holy, the lump alſo is holy, and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> I know the ſtream of our Divine Advocates for Infant-Baptiſm run altogether, and out of this Text, upon a derivative holineſs from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Anceſtors, to their children, which notwithſtanding they call and make a federal holineſs; I am not willing, in my old and infirm daies, to ſtrive or ſwim againſt a ſtream, onely I will be bold to venture, and wade ſo far, as to hint again, and mention unto thoſe akilful ſteerſmen, now eſpecially that the waters of ſtrife about Infant-Baptiſm are riſen high, what great difficulties, and intricate Objections are laid upon the Point, as pleaded and held to be derived from the faith or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Parents and Anceſtors, the which, for my part, I have not found ſo eaſie to extricate and ſhake off; though I have ſaid ſomething for it, and enough againſt my Antipoedo baptiſt hare. I do therefore refer this to better Confideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Plea for Infant Baptiſm would not be ſtronger, cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more conſonant to the Truth, (not that I any way do implead the other, as weak, dark, or diſſonant) if it be made directly and primitively from the Covenant it ſelf, and the ſaith (of which before much is ſaid) and the holineſs of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren themſelves thereby.</p>
                     <p>I ſee indeed, our worthy Divines do interpret, and call the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:168478:91"/>derivative holineſs, from Parents to their children, a federal holineſs too; and ſo we all agree together in our general mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: but would it not be more properly, and rightly called, a federal holineſs, if it were ſaid to be derived from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, as to Parents, ſo to children, to both joyntly, equally and indifferently made? And methinks the Text a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited ſpeaks clear for it, ſomewhat clearer in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal than in the Tranſlation, as to the former part, but if the firſt fruit (be) holy, And, or ſo, the lump is; if the root (be) holy, And, or ſo, the branches are. And thus we ſhall not need to fly to Parental holineſs, as ſometimes we are driven (or faith, of which before,) for the upholding of holineſs in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſeeing we may have federal holineſs for them; the which I know not, but that it may be called a perſonal holineſs, (ſure it is not an abſtract Metaphyſical, Metaphorical, or an aerial imaginary notion) I ſay a perſonal holineſs, being in or upon the perſons of children, as the Covenant is, and as other rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive privileges, and the imputative righteouſneſs of Chriſt are.

And therefore alſo, ſome of thoſe our Divines do Expound the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Root, and firſt fruit, in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to be the Covenant, (and in a good ſenſe and ſounding to that I have ſaid, it may be ſo) upon which <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, and ſo along, all believing Parents and their, children, do grow together as holy lumps and branches; and it is by vertue of ſuch Covenant, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and every believing Parent, is called and meant, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly root and firſt fruits, and their children or poſterity, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly branches or lump.</p>

For not onely the Jewiſh children the natural branches of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham,</hi> (if he be the holy root, as he is, but by vertue and in reſpect of the Covenant) are holy and partakers of holineſs, and the other privileges thereof; but even ſo Gentiliſh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the natural branches of their converted Parents or Parent, being alſo a holy root, as its ſaid, the root of <hi>Jeſſe, Eſa.</hi> 11. ſtill by vertue and in reſpect of the Covenant, are holy, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of holineſs and other privileges thereof: But, (to derive the Pedigree, as I may ſo call it, of holineſs of children to its firſt original and root,) I think, I may ſafely ſay, that all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and their children, both Gentiliſh and Jewiſh, even up to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed <hi>Iſaac,</hi> were holy branches, and partakers of holineſs, and other privileges, from the Covenant it ſelf, as the firſt original and root of their holineſs.</p>
                     <p>Another Text there is, that doth eminently hold out the holineſs of Chriſtian infants by Covenant, which is <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.25. <hi>We who are Jews by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles:</hi> (of which becauſe I have had a former occaſion to ſay ſomething, I ſhall need to adde but a little,) there Jews by nature or birth, are put in oppoſition to ſinners of the Gentiles, juſt as he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Beſides that, they are dedicated and conſecrated to God, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:168478:92"/>deſigned to holineſs, as Candidates thereof (as ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were wont to call the infants of Chriſtians,) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are holy, as the Temple is holy, the Sabbath is holy, the Prieſts were holy.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets every where call the Jews, a holy Nation, and holy people, in reſpect, and by vertue of the Covenant; and ſhall not the children of that Nation and people, being alſo in Covenant, be holy federally too? yea, in therefore called, <hi>a holy ſeed, Ezra</hi> 9.3. in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.38. <hi>a holy flock is the flock of Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſhall not the little Lambs, a great part of the flock, be holy too? The viſible Catholique Church is holy, and ſo are particular viſible Churches, and all the members of the ſame are federally holy, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo little children are ſo, who are members of the ſame, even as the little finger is a member of the body, and partaker of the bodily external cleanneſs.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, is not the external Covenant it ſelf holy? why then, ſure, all who are taken and aſſumed into it, are Covenantly holy, and they are, Parents and their children.</p>
                     <p>And ſo now laſtly, I will ſhut up this Point, (as I have done often before, even all along before,) with this Syllogiſm, to bring you ſtill into more love, and liking of our Univerſity Arts and Sciences, one whereof is, Logical ſyllogiſing; and it ſhall be this.</p>
                     <p>All perſons in the Church, holy, and ſo reputed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to be, by their being in, and under the holy Covenant of God, or by being children of a believing Parent or Parents in Covenant, may and ought to have the holy Initial Seal of that Covenant, which in the Goſpel is, Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>But all infants in the Church of believing Parents, are ſuch perſons, holy, and ſo reputed by the Apoſtle, to be by their being in and under the holy Covenant, or by being children of a believing Parent or Parents in Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Therefore all infants in the Church, may and ought to have the holy initial Seal of the Covenant, which in the Goſpel is, Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>You will now, Sir, of your ſelf (I ſhall not need to urge or adviſe you,) being experienced and practiſed often before therein, now the eighth time, with much facility, deny the concluſion.</p>

                     <p>And whereas I have put in my whole Diſcourſe, all theſe my eight or nine Arguments into the form of a Syllogiſm, I have done is the better to inform you, (to which you pretend to be willing, in the cloſe of your Letter.)

But of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there is enough written before; and how it ſhould now at the laſt appear to you, that the moſt learned by Humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, do want the learning of the Spirit, to interpret Scripture, (if you mean it of thoſe who interpret the Scriptures for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm, againſt you) it is marvelous to me; for I will inſtance but in this one, and laſt interpretation of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>But now they are holy:</hi> We interpret it, holy federally, as who are born in Covenant with God, and of a believing Parent or Parents in Covenant with God, and ſo are not unclean, as the Gentiles out of Covenant; but you interpret it, holy legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, as who are lawfully born of Parents in wedlock accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law, and ſo are not unclean, as baſtards born out of wedlock: now do you remember your words, four times repeated in one of your pages, I will repeat them once more for you, but to you, <hi>Judge you, but judge you righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for God will:</hi> judge you, I ſay, whether of the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſavours moſt of Humane learning, or the learning of the Spirit, yours or ours? doth it not clearly appear to your eyes, that your interpretation is a meer Humane, natural, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, political interpretation, and ſuch as you can bring no word or example for, from the learning of the Spirit, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where holy are called or meant, legitimates; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, baſtards; and therefore it is a meer Humane learning, and not agreeable to the learning of the Spirit, nay repugnant to it, for by the learning of the Spirit, all baſtards are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, nor all legitimates, holy.</p>
                     <p>But our interpretation is a very Divine, gracious, ſpiritual, Eccleſiaſtical interpretation, and ſuch as I have brought both word and example for, from the Scriptures, the learning of the Scriptures, where all in Covenant with God, or born of Chriſtians, or one Chriſtian Parent, are ſtiled holy, and all childeren born out of Covenant, or of Parents both Heathens, are called unclean; and therefore ours is the very learning of the Spirit, (to take your words now out of your mouth, and put them into ours, as juſtly I may) according to the minde
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:168478:93"/>of the Spirit, as who declared unto us, in the Scriptures, and we from it, to you, that all Covenanters, born of Covenanters with God, are holy, and all out of Covenant, and born of ſuch as are out of Covenant, are unclean.</p>
                     <p>And ſo now by this (as indeed by all, or moſt of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that you have made uſe of throughout your whole Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which rather you have made an abuſe of) it will appear, yea doth, that your ſelf is one of them, the moſt learned by Humane learning, (certainly, Sir, for all your talk againſt it, you have been at the Univerſity, and gotten up ſome Humane learning, and are a great Practitioner therein, as appears by this, and your other interpretations) yea, I take you to be a man, if not a Maſter of Arts and Humane learning, more than of the learning of the Spirit (though pretending to this more) a better Humaniſt than Divine, or rather an Alchymiſt, who can extract out of the Spirits holy, in Scripture, the ſpirit and fleſh to a child lawfully born, and out of ſpirits unclean, the quinteſſence of a baſtard.</p>

                     <p>But now again, Sir, why do you follow, <hi>And if you can anſwer theſe Quaeres and Conſiderations by plain Scripture, I pray do, or elſe hold your peace, and leave your unwarrantable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices?</hi> Did you not tell me but even now, that I was informed now by your Quaeres and Conſiderations, ſo that I could not plead ignorance? and what, will you have me anſwer them, when as I am fully informed by them, and have gotten full knowledge by them? ſhall I anſwer againſt my information, and diſpute againſt my knowledge of your truths? you even here contradict your ſelf, and your own ſpirit and ſpeech; as it often falls out to them that have ſuch ſpeeches, and ſuch a ſpirit of contradiction of others.</p>
                     <p>But if I can anſwer them, and that by Scripture (it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it ſeems, or otherwiſe why do you pray me to do it) then ſure you have not rightly informed, but rather miſ-informed me, and miſ-interpreted the Scriptures; and therefore I may more juſtly ſet upon the anſworing them, to inform you better in the knowledge of the truth, and to infirm in you the grounds of your errours; which I have done by plain Scriptures, and by <hi>Arguments alſo proved by direct and plain Scriptures, rightly interpreted.</hi> And now that it is done, I will command my ſelf to hold my peace, and enjoyn my ſelf ſilence. You (boldly enough) prayed me to do it, or elſe hold my peace; and I (kindly enough) have done it, and do hold my peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.1. <hi>It was for Zions ſake, that I held not my peave,</hi> and for Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:168478:98"/>ſake, that I did not reſt, <hi>until the reighteouſneſs thereof went forth as brightneſs,</hi> or rather ſome little glympſe brighter by my enlightning, ſome ſmall ſtep farther, by my upholding, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Gods enlightening of it, and Gods upholding of it; <hi>For not I,</hi>

                     <p>But I muſt not thus make an end; you, Sir, will not let me return to my reſt, or give me a Writ of eaſe, until I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſome certain Texts of Scriptures, which you have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out to the full of the words, and left with me, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clufion of your Letter. There is not reaſon the Reader ſhould be deprived of them, they are ſo excellent for the purpoſe, and ſo pertinent to the cauſe; they come like after-drops, when a ſtorm of rain is over.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, <hi>Job</hi> 6.24, 25. <hi>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue, cauſe me to underſtand wherein I have erred: how, orceable</hi> (forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) <hi>are right words? but what doth your arguinges</hi> (arguing) <hi>(or Arguments) reprove? do ye imagie</hi> (imagine) <hi>to reprove words</hi> (Why do you leave out that which followeth? with your leave, I will add it, as belonging to the former) <hi>and the ſpeeches of one that is deſperate, which are as winde.</hi> This is kindly ſpoken of you to me, as of <hi>Job</hi> to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his friend, if as truly meant; and I think I may ſay in juſtification of the truth more than my ſelf <hi>(for wiſdom is juſtified of her children)</hi> that the thing is really done, you are taught the truth here, and cauſed to underſtand wherein you have erred, and may hold, if wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to learn; therefore hold your peace, as a friend anſwered, and therein ſatisfied, without reply, as another friend only que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, and thereby convinced, was ſpeechleſs, without anſwer, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.12. But I ſuſpect you have not told me all your heart, and do but mock, as <hi>Delilah</hi> told <hi>Sampſon.</hi> I fear I ſhall never teach you, who have learned as much as you deſire to know; I may (perhaps) cauſe ſome other, an indifferent Reader or ſo, to underſtand wherein you have erred; but your ſelf, the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:168478:98"/>principal party, I ſhall not, I foreſee, according to that Text, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.22. the words whereof, for want of time, I have not written out. Nor will you hold your peace, for all your ſaying ſo, you muſt or may, as to any material or ſubſtantial replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you can make againſt the truth herein aſſerted and proved; but you neither will, nor can hold your peace, as to frivilous multiplication of words, impertinent citations, and miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations and miſ-applications of Texts, ſlanderous calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations of Miniſters, and the Anſwerer eſpecially, no more than the dog in the dark night, can or will leave barking and bawling at the bright Moon.</p>
                     <p>But how feeble and impotent are crooked and impertinent words, appears by <hi>Job,</hi> ſaying, <hi>How forcible are right words?</hi> the other words, What doth your arguings or arguments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, as unfitting and unſeaſonable for you to uſe unto me, before you had heard or read any word or ſyllable of any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or argument from me; You might rather have left them out for me to have ſaid them to you, as now I ſhall, after that I have read over and heard your arguings and arguments, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quaeres, Gonſiderations, Interpretations, without any arguings or arguments in them; What do they reprove? Indeed they reprove ſomething, every thing, thoſe things that deſerve no reproof, but they prove nothing, no not thoſe things that moſt needed proof, and which you undertook to prove (which indeed moved and occaſioned me to be thus large in ſetting down the things in controverſie betwixt us, by proving, and diſproving, and reproving ſometimes, leſt all the time ſhould be as loſt and miſ-ſpent betwixt us, and no body, nor our ſelves the better by this diſcourſe.)</p>
                     <p>The laſt words are right words for us both, and very forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inform me, and reform my imagination, which hath been, to reprove words and ſpeeches of one that is deſperate; (you were very loth to write out theſe words, and good cauſe why) which are as wind; ſo are both the words and ſpeeches of one that is deſperate, and ſo are the reprooſs of ſuch words and ſpeeches of one that is deſperate; you, out of hope of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I, out of hope of teaching; according to that Text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. &amp; <hi>Jerem.</hi> 13.23. <hi>The words whereof I have not written out for want of time.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>The other Texts that you have heaped up together, and at large tranſcribed, are nothing but very Quakeriſms in the end of your Letter, to which Anabaptiſms will come in the end; you have here begun, though you are not the firſt. For as it is the faſhion of Quakers, to get up into their memories and mouths, all the Texts of old and new Teſtament, where any falſe and vicious Prophets are ſpoken of, and againſt, or any covetous and ſuperſtitious Phariſee is taxed and reproved, and to flap them in the face of every Miniſter they meet withall, though never ſo impertinently and inconſiderately; inſomuch that one of them very lately being at Church, after the Miniſter had ended his Sermon, as who preacheth conſtantly every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day twice; Yea, ſaid he, this is juſt as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10. <hi>They are all dumb dogs, that cannot bark, ſleeping, lying down,</hi> &amp;c. And juſt even ſo do you, Sir, firſt you tell me of <hi>Jerem.</hi> 5.4. and have now time enough to write out the words at length, and not in figures, <hi>Surely theſe are poor, they are fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgement of there</hi> (their) <hi>God.</hi> The which is ſpoken of the ignorant and perverſe people amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Prophet complains of, like as we Miniſters may of many ſuch amongſt us, your ſelf not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and I commend you for your fit and pertinent, and even Quaker-like application of it, to us the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> whom you know to know the way of the Lord, &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apply it againſt your own ſcience and conſcience, to Miniſters, which is ſpoken onely to the People by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
                     <p>The next is, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.5, 11, 12. <hi>Neither here is there to you any want of time, to write out all the words: Thus ſaith the Lord, concerning the prophets that make my people to erre, that byte</hi> (bite) <hi>with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into there</hi> (their) <hi>mouth, they even prepare war againſt them. The Heads thereof judge for reward, and the Prieſt thereof teach for byre</hi> (hire) <hi>and the Prophets thereof devine</hi> (divine) <hi>for money, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord amongſt us? none evil can come unto us. Therefore ſhall Zyon</hi> (Zion) <hi>for your ſakes be plowed as a field,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>What if there were in the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> both Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, ſuch corruptions as are mentioned in thoſe Texts,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:168478:99"/>at that time, what reaſon or Religion, prudence or conſcience, is there in this, to make uſe, and your application of them to our State, both of Magiſtracy or Miniſtry, until you had clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Doctrine and proof of the ſame ſins to reign amongſt both? What Prophet do you know makes the People to erre, bite with the teeth, and cry peace, to teach for hire, and if their mouths be not filled, to prepare for war? do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member who it was that ſaid, <hi>And how like unto him you are herein,</hi> doth <hi>Job ſerve God for nought?</hi> and who ſaid, <hi>Ye are of your father the devil?</hi> he is the accuſer of the Brethren, and a falſe accuſer; we Miniſters teach not for hire, and yet we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers are worthy of our hire; and if it be detained, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of our mouths, the Law is open, they may implead one another, (as I have largely ſhewed before) we may flie into the arms of the Law, which is no Law of Arms, or War. But farther, the word of <hi>Micah</hi> was that which he ſaid concerning <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and (for any thing appears) the word in the Text might be concerning <hi>Samaria,</hi> and not <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and then it concerns you more than us, you more and your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, for <hi>Samaria</hi> was the head City of the ſeparate <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his company, the ten Tribes who divided from the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and departed away from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> and the Temple, and ſet up their Calves in ſome private ſtalls and houſes; and ſo ever after continued ſeparates, ſo that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had no dealing with the <hi>Jews</hi> ordinarily, when Chriſt came and lived with them, but kept aloof and apart from the publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>The third is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.12, &amp; 15. <hi>O my people, they which lead the</hi> (thee) <hi>cauſe the</hi> (thee) <hi>to erre, and deſroy</hi> (deſtroy) <hi>the way of thy paths. What mean you to beat my people to pieces</hi> (pieces) <hi>and grind the face of the poor, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Neither here wanted you any time to write out all the words. Beſides, here's excellent good order in your proceedings, from <hi>Eſay</hi> to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah,</hi> from <hi>Micah</hi> to <hi>Eſay,</hi> by a new retrograde method, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your old crab-order, backward and forward, forward and backward. But theſe words are wholly and ſolely directed by the Prophet, to the ſecular Powers and Civil Rulers of the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the which if you by-your bold and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſpirit, ſhall, as you do here, (or elſe you are quite out of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:168478:100"/>your Texts) revile the Temporal Rulers of our Nation, <hi>with beating Gods people to pieces, and grinding the face of the poor,</hi> I muſt refer you over to their Temporal Authority and Juſtice, to chaſtiſe your inſolency and rebellion, according to thoſe Texts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4 the which for want of time, I have not writ out in all the words.</p>
                     <p>The next is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.30. &amp; 31. <hi>A wonderfull and horrible</hi> (thing) <hi>is committed in the land, the prophets propleſie falsely</hi> (talſly) <hi>and the prieſt</hi> (prieſts) <hi>bare</hi> (bear) <hi>rule by there</hi> (their) <hi>means, and my people love to have it ſo; and what will ye do in the end thereof?</hi> Falſly written, and falſly applied is all this Text. In what, and which of our Prophets, (for ſo and ſuch you make us, and muſt grant us, or all your Applications of the Prophets to us, out of prophets, is vain, impertinent, and inconſiſtent) I ſay, which of our Prophets, and wherein do they propheſie falſly? we neither foretell or reveal hidden particular things to come; ſome of your Prophets do, as Chriſts coming to reign temporally and gloriouſly upon earth for a thouſand years, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the very year of the beginning of his Reign; and have herein propheſied falſly, for the year is paſſed of late where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome of them ſaid it ſhould begin.</p>
                     <p>Or if you mean by prophecying, expounding and interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, I will go no farther than your ſelf, for a falſe prophet, at the next door, (becauſe I am weary with travelling thus far,) than whom, if there be a more falſe Expounder and Interpreter of Scripture, as I have abundantly declared through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this whole Tractate, I will forfeit all my Commentaries upon the Bible, into his hands, if he will reade them, and take them ſo into his head, thereby, by ſuch help, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a true Expounder and Interpreter of the Scriptures after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. As for our Prieſts bearing rule, by their means; your own eyes, looking about you, may ſerve to give your tongue (I will not ſay, the lie) an anſwer to the contrary. And for our People love to have it ſo; I thought you had been better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the People than ſo, or to ſay ſo of them, for the People love to have it otherwiſe than ſo, that Prieſts ſhould bear rule by any means. And if you love the People no better than ſo, to ſay they love to have it ſo, they may (likely) begin not to love you ſo as they have done, to make you a Father or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:168478:100"/>Son of the People, and <hi>Vox Populi,</hi> (I think you underſtand that word) a Preacher of the Peoples making, and a voice of a Crier in the Wilderneſs, againſt <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> though your name-ſake, and their Childrens Baptiſm. And for the laſt Clauſe, <hi>And what will ye do in the end?</hi> Here's a Quaere indeed; I who have anſwered ſo many of your Quaeres before, will not ſtand out for this one at laſt; but will tell you what I will do in the end (let others tell you what they will do in the end.)</p>
                     <p>I will now in the end, pray to God, (and I do ſo) that he would give unto you a better underſtanding of his Word into your head, and a greater love of his Miniſters into your heart. For (to end with that you began the Text with) a wonderfull and horrible thing is committed in the Land, and by you, for one and a chief one, ſome prophets (but they are onely ſo called by ſome) expound the Word of God falſly, and revile the Miniſters of God falſly, and the Prieſts and Jeſuites bear rule by their means, and ſome people love to have it ſo; and what will you do in the end? I hope you will have doen in the end, and hold your peace at laſt, as you promiſed even now by your Sarety <hi>Job,</hi> in your firſt Text; which you have cauſe to do, leſt <hi>Job</hi> minde you of it, and ſay, as he doth, <hi>Job</hi> 18.2. <hi>How long will it be ere you make an end of words?</hi> (words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and little elſe beſides.) I hope you will do ſo anon, for I perceive the next Text is your laſt you end with.</p>
                     <p>Matth. 23.4. <hi>Foor</hi> (for) <hi>they bind heavie burdens, and grievous to be bourne</hi> (born) <hi>and lay them on mens ſhoulders, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will not move them with one of there</hi> (their) <hi>fingers; in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandements of men,</hi> Matth. 15.19. <hi>And if ye love me, keep my commandements,</hi> John 14.15. For ſo I have put your three laſt Texts together into one, as being all much as one, that ſo I might bring your words the ſooner to an end. Neither here wanted you time to write out all the words, even of three Texts together: yet I ſee you are as far off from an end, as when you began; for you here fall back again upon your old matter you began withal, to quaere me about Commandements of God, and mens Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Preſcriptions; ſay once more out of your former Text, <hi>What will ye do in the end?</hi> I muſt anſwer you from theſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:168478:101"/>Texts, That I muſt now do in the end, the ſame I did in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, diſcourſe again of the Commands of God, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of men. But I am reſolved otherwiſe, having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up the ſtone to the top of the hill, not to let it roul back, or tumble down again, this would make my labour endleſs, and my pains infernal, and Hellike, which are ſupernal now, and Heaven-like; nor will I ſuffer you to begin the <hi>Sute</hi> again, but will force you to joyn iſſue, and to come to trial, and ſo to an end. In vain, Sir, you will tell me, that we worſhip God in vain, teaching for Doctrines the Commandements of men; when as you do not here (as not heretofore) teach me, and tell me what Commandement of man we make, or teach, for a part of Divine Doctrine or Worſhip. We teach and embrace the Political and Eccleſiaſtical Commands of the Supreme Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over us, as preſcriptive Orders, and directive Rules, about the external carriage, and outward celebration of the publick Divine Service and Worſhip, to make it the more comely and in order (and have not you the ſame <hi>Collinical</hi> and domeſtical Orders and Rules about your private Congregations and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, and ſo teach for Doctrincs the Commands of men, and worſhip God in vain, by your Text?) What a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is this in you, to write thus in vain; and in fine, to ſhew nothing of ours in vain, but onely words in vain of your own? So likewiſe, why do ye not name ſome one of thoſe heavie burdens, grievous to be born, that we either lay upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhoulders, or if laſd by others, we our ſelves are not ready to move them with one of our fingers. As for the old legal burdens and yokes, of keeping the Law in all its Morals and Ceremonials, as to juſtification and ſalvation thereby, we were, and are ſo far from laying them on mens ſhoulders, no not with one of our fingers, that with both our hands, and not ours only, but with the hands of the Apoſtlet, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. we do pull them off, knowing that neither our Fathers, nor we, (for our ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders yet are underlaid by them, as well as others) were able to bear them, and to lay no greater burden upon men, than things neceſſary as to ſalvation, than the yoke and burden of Chriſt, of which the one is caſie, and the other light, as Chriſt himſelf ſaid of it, who alſo maketh it ſo unto all that undergo the ſame, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29, 30. This is no other than the Goſpel, the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:168478:101"/>Doctrine and Commands of Chriſt, the which, as his yoke, draweth in all; and as his burden, beareth out all Evangelical Graces and Duties, which we Miniſters in the Name of Chriſt impoſe upon our People, or rather call upon them, to take this yoke and burden of Chriſt upon them, and to learn of him, and to practiſe as he did (things learnable, practicable, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.) And theſe burdens and yokes we alſo, as yoke-fellows, and burden-fellows with our people, we are even with both our hands, and all our hearts, ready to move, ſtir, and lift at, and lift up, as upon our own, ſo their ſhoulders, bearing our parts, and helping them to bear their parts, in repenting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, praying, &amp;c. ſo <hi>bearing one anothers burthens,</hi> as the Apoſtle adviſeth, <hi>Gal</hi> 62. yea with heart and mouth, praying for them, and preaching to them, we ſtrengthen the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees, as the Prophet bids us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.6. by ſaying to them that are of a fearfull heart, Be ſtrong fear not, if any faint under their burden, or hold it not faſt, or ſtand not ſure under it, or grow weary of well-doing, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 6.9. and as the Apoſtle again exhorteth, 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 5.14. we are alwaies ready to <hi>comfort the feeble-minded, and to ſupport the weak, and to be patient towards all men,</hi> (as active towards ſome) for we that are ſtrong (or ſtronger than ſome others of our people; I may ſay) ought (and ſome of us, I ſay do, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to do as we ought) to <hi>bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves,</hi> Rom. 15.1. nay we cannot pleaſe our ſelves, if we be ſuch as we ought to be, better, I think, I am ſure, we cannot pleaſe God better, than by bearing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the weak, and helping them to bear their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</p>
                     <p>What would you, Sir, have more of us? do you ſo much your ſelves? are not you rather of thoſe bad Scribes and Phariſees, and in their coat and ſeat, whom you quote and cite againſt us?</p>
                     <p>For a Scribe, I think you are none, or a very bad one, who not only cannot write true Engliſh of your own, without a Copie, but even when you have a Copie before you, and write out of the Bible, cannot write the true Engliſh out of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, witneſs my Corrections of your Tranſscipts of theſe laſt Texts.</p>

                     <p>And there was another piece of the ſame ſtuff in it beſides: for the former part of your Letter being of matters, and points of Divinity in Queſtion betwixt us, it was your policy and hypocriſie, to ſet down to your Tene's and Aſſertions, Texts of Scripture, named and figured by Chapter and Verſe, ſo to put a fair gloſs and Iuſtre of Truth, for the amuſing of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar people, and deluding them with ſuch ſhews and paints of proof, you knowing they neither have skill nor will, nor lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor pleaſure to turn to the words themſelves and weigh them, of which you might have ſaved them the labour and me alſo; (but that you meant not, but rather to put me to the pains, wherein you loſt your labour and purpoſes, for that it is a pleaſure to me to ſearch the Scriptures) if you had written out the words into your ſheets, and folded up them with your Arguments or Expoſitions together into the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But then there was another fear or Quakery in it, (for Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are ever a fraid of diſcovery, and Quake for fear of it, as the Devils believe, but tremble for the ſame fear of being diſcovered in their falſe faith.) For you feared and might well enough, that if you had written out the words of your Texts, and ſet them down together, or by your Opinions and Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; people muſt needs ſee and reade both together, and ſo comparing the one with the other, the words of the Texts ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with the words of your Tenees aſſerted, they might eſpy and diſcern (as an ordinary underſtanding may do) the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of the one to the other, yea the contrariety of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in them.</p>
                     <p>And truly this was, and it a notable piece of Popery and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſm, to keep the people as much as may be, from the words of the Scripture; for the words of the Scripture <hi>are pure, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the eyes,</hi> but peoples darkneſs beſt for their devotion, they know and ſay: Therefore indeed was I the willinger to look into every Text cited by you, that ſo I might preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reader whomſoever, the Texts of Scriptures in words at length, and not in figures, (as I ſaid before, if I remember well) and ſo giving him a plain outſight of the words, He may come to a clearer infight of the ſenſe, and better diſcern what it proveth or proveth not: A good way to disfigure an onely
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:168478:103"/>Text ſcribe, and to reverſe and decapitate, a verſe and Chapter Hypocrite.</p>
                     <p>But there is more of the ſame cloath, your Linſie Woolſie hypocriſie here, at the end of your Letter; for uſually he that plaies the Hypocrite in the beginning, works the Hypocrite in the end, and turns to be of a merry, a very one; when you were engaged to prove and fortifie your Tenets, as hitherto, you onely ſet down Chapter and verſe, but not the words, why ſo? you could not ſtand about writing them down for want of time, no no, that was not the cauſe, for being but newly begun, it was free to you to have taken as much time as you would: was it not rather for want of truch, and out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſubtlety and policy, leſt the Reader finding Gods words, and your words in the ſame place together, might the eaſier at one view ſee the diſtance, and diffonancy of the one from the other, and ſo perceive the weakneſs of proof in your allegation?</p>
                     <p>But now that you are reſolved in the end, (for a friendly farewel) to reprove, yea to revile, and reproach the true Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the true Miniſters thereof, and now in the foot of your Letter, without any foot, or ground, unleſs <hi>the foot of Pride,</hi> (like as you did the ſame in the front of your Letter, without any front or brow, but that of Braſſe) to trample under your unclean, and ſtinking feet, the ſweet, and precious Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> (like as you doſſed them before with your braſen, and impudent forehead) it ſeems now at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of your Letter, you can finde time enough (though it be high time you ſhould have done two hours, and two ſheets ago) to write out fully the words of ſix or ſeven Texts, ſpoken of ſome falſe, and erroneous Prophets, yea, and of ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Judges, and Magiſtrates, yea, and ſome ignorant, and ſottiſh people, ſome thouſands of years fithence, and to apply them to the learned, pious, and laborious Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> very fooliſhly, impertinently, inconfiderately, yea very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, maliciouſly, devilliſhly.</p>
                     <p>Oh here you are very exact, and diligent to write out all, and the very words, that your proſelites reading here, may learn the Scripture phraſes and words, and get them by heart, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:168478:103"/>have them ready in their mouths, as <hi>Shimei</hi> had the ſtones in his hand, to caſt them at <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, and to aſperſe, ſlander, and bequaker the Miniſters of God, who are ſuch according to Gods will, as they paſſe by them, or meet with them; <hi>Remember (Lord) the reproach of thy ſervants, how we do bear in our beſoms the reproaches of the mighty people: Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the footſteps of thine Anointed, Pſal.</hi> 89.56.</p>
                     <p>Why did you not write out a thouſand Texts more, word for word, even all in the Bible, that mention any ſin or vice, of any Nation, any erroneous or prophane perſon, of any place there recorded, and make application of them all to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Miniſters there of? This would have made the heap of your ſtones the bigger, and ſo would have heaped up more wrath for you, againſt the day of wrath, for your ſpeaking evil of Dignities, and reviling Orders; and eſpecially for your teaching vulgar people, errors, confuſions, as to renounce their firſt Baptiſm, and reproach their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Baptizing Miniſters, and that in Scripture Language, and Phraſes which they learn of you, and ſuch as you, who writ: out the Texts, and the words too, when you wreſt Scripture to the vilifying of Miniſters, and you want no time, nor malice for the doing of it, to put ſuch words into your peoples eyes, and ears, and mouth: but when you are to wreſt Scriptures, for the juſtifying of your errors, then you cite the Text onely, but write not the words, for want of time, and truth too, and ſo feed their ſenſes onely with figures, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers onely, ſending them away to ſearch out the words, for their ſatisfying their underſtandings, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did the <hi>Iſaelites</hi> to finde out ſtraw, for their burning the Brick.</p>
                     <p>But I remember your laſt Text you cited, wherewith you think, you have hit us home, was that off the <hi>Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, laying heavy burdens upon mens,</hi> or the peoples <hi>ſhoulders, and not moving them, with one of their fingers.</hi> I have put by the blow, as of all the other your Texts alleged againſt us, ſo of this, and the Scribiſm of the ſame, and have made them to recoil-back &amp; fly in your own face, becauſe you overcharged, and had no kill to charge aright: you hold as great, if not a greater correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:168478:104"/>with the Phariſees, than the Scribes; Few of you are Scribes, more are Phariſees: for you are like unto them in your name, the word Phariſee ſignifying Separate, (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I ſaid,) ſo in your corrupting, and falſe interpreting of Scripture (this I have ſhewed throughout this Diſcourſe) ſo in your high conceipt, of your own righteouſneſs and holineſs, (this you manifeſt in your ſcornful, and ſupercilious loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This latter, is the thing, I will ſhew out off, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. where ver. 5. <hi>There aroſe up certain of the Sect of the Phariſees which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> or profeſſed Jeſus to be the Meſſia, <hi>ſaying it was needful to Circumciſe the newly</hi> converted Brethren, &amp;c. the matter is decided in the 10. ver. 28. ver. <hi>Now therefore, why tempt you God? who put a yoke upon the neck of the Diſciples, which neither our Fathers, nor we were able to bear: And it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and us, to lay upon you, no greater burden, than theſe neceſſary thing, &amp;c.</hi> Out of which I gather, and deduct this one General Propoſition (leaving out the particular of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.)</p>
                     <p>Things laid upon Chriſtians or Diſciples, more than neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are a burden and yoke, and ſeemeth not good to the Holy Ghoſt, but is a tempting of God. Joyn we iſſue now in brief. Here the Phariſees of the old ſeparation ſaid, it was needful to Circumciſe the new converted Chirſtians or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and you of the newer ſeparation ſay, it is needful to re-Baptize grown, and profeſſing Chriſtians or Diſciples, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a particular confeſſion of their Faith; are not you now agreeable to the Phariſees, in laying on a burden, and a yoke, upon the necks, and ſhoulders off the Diſciples and Chriſtians?</p>
                     <p>But, how do I ſhew this latter, to be a burden or yoke? why, from the Propoſition here, becauſe the re-Baptizing of Chriſtians or Diſciples, who were Baptized formerly in their
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:168478:104"/>Infancy, is more than needful or neceſſary; andthat it is ſo, my whole laſt part of this Diſcourſe, which now I am finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath amply Demonſtrated; yea, your own Rule given to me at firſt, doth joyntly atteſt the ſame, the which is this, of all things neceſſary to Salvation, the Scripture hath either a Command or an Example, or both. Now ſhew me for that your practiſe, any Command of God, Expreſſe, or Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, or by Conſequence, for ſuch your re-Baptizing; Or any Example of any grown perſon or Chriſtians, formerly Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſo re-Baptized; if you cannot, hold you your peace (they are your own words,) I will ſpeak you a Phariſee, laying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens necks, and ſhoulders, a yoke, and a burden; and moreover by doing ſo, a tempter of God, and doer of that, which ſeemed not good unto the Holy Ghoſt, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
                     <p>Again, for you to require of Infants born in Covenant with God, and of Parents in Covenant with God, an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confeſſion, or profeſſion of Faith, before you will put them under the initial Seal of that Covenant, and in the mean while to with hold this from them, until they ſhall do that, is a putting a yoke, and burden upon their necks and ſhoulders, to hinder them in their Chriſtian progreſſe; it is to tempt the Lord, and to put him upon other means for Infants Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than Baptiſm, and its a doing of that, which ſeemeth not good to the Spirit, and the Apoſtles aſſembled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the caſe in a holy Synod, for, that it is a requiring more of Infants, than is neceſſary to needful for their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                     <p>Yet once more: The leading of grown Chriſtians, Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed before, into ſome deep Pond, and therein re-Baptizing them, plunging, and holding them ſome while there under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter over-head and ears, body and cloaths too, is a yoke upon the neck, and a burthen put, and laid upon the head and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, heavy and grievous to be borne, eſpecially of the aged, infirm, and ſickly, and a doing of more than is neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the adminiſtration of Baptiſin, unſeemly, and ſuperfluous if not ridiculous, and ſo more than ſeemeth good un to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and the Apoſtles met in Counſel yea it is an temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:168478:105"/>of God, (and ſome, as I have heard, have ſickned and died ſoon after thereupon,) of which I ſhall diſcourſe at large, in my Narration, &amp; cenſure of a late dipping which followeth.</p>
                     <p>Now ſee, Sir, by this, whether we Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or you Separates from the ſame, be like to the Phariſees.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I have retorted, all your Texts, and returned them to you again, to apply them to your ſelves, or to apply your ſelves to them.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore onely give you the like friendly farewel at the end of my Letter, as you gave me in yours, namely, a few Texts of Scripture to conſider of, and ſeriouſly to weigh, ſome for your ſelf, and others, that take upon you to be Preachers of the Separation, to conſider of, and that not ſlightly as you uſe: <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.11. and 12. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21, 31, 32. 2 <hi>Corinh.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.10, and 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, and 5, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 19. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16</p>
                     <p>Some for your followers, and others that hear you, and (if any of my people be amongſt them) for them alſo to conſider of, and that not lightly 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24, 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 38, 39, 40. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.1. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.6, and 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, 18, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.7, 8, 9, 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, and 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. and 24, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Jude</hi> 17, 18, 19. 20. And this one, for all, and every one of you, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, 4. 5.</p>
                     <p>You ſee, Sir, I do not as you did, for whereas in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Proof, I have written out the words of every Text to the full, here in point of Reproof, I onely name the Texts, and no more; ſo the Reader cannot know the particular here of them, until he take the Bible, and look farther, ſo ready I am, not to blazen abroad, but rather to go backward and cover your nakedneſs, as <hi>Cham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, What have I done? I thought indeed I had done, and replyed to all your Letter: But I perceive, that it is undone, as who have omitted one of your Texts, which is in your laſt line of all, <hi>John</hi> 14.15. and in theſe words of Chriſt Jeſut, <hi>If you love me, keep my Commandements.</hi> What a bad-ſighted
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:168478:105"/>man am I, that I ſhould take no ſooner notice of theſe laſt words, of your laſt Text, in your laſt line? words, like Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gold, with pictures of Silver, as ſpoken in ſeaſon; a Text, like a bundle of Mirth, worthy to be laid betwixt the breaſts. A line, Sir, I ſpeak ſeriouſly, worth all your Letter beſides, and had it not been for this laſt line, it had been ſo far from being any Love-Letter, or Meſſage of <hi>Jonathans</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> that rather it would have been, as <hi>Davids</hi> Letter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> or a <hi>Johnathan</hi>'s <hi>Maranatha</hi> Letter, writing bitter things, as <hi>Marah,</hi> and breathing out not onely excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, but even damnation, whoſe mouth I have ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped notwithſtanding, <hi>If you love me, keep my Commandements, John</hi> 14.15. ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples; This is a text to purpoſe, which few or none of the former were, brcathing love at laſt, the beſt thing to end a Letter with, and to make ſome recompence for all your hateful, horrid, helliſh, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, calumniations, of your Mother, and Brethren, in the beginning thereof; Above all things, and ſo in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and after things (and ſo in the end) <hi>Put on love, which is the Bond of perfectneſſe;</hi> The Law maketh nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but love doth: for the end, and ſo the perfection, and fulfilling of the Commandement, is Love, out of a pure heart, and a good Conſcience, and Faith unfeigned; at leaſtwiſe Chriſt Jeſus, whom we love, (as who loved us firſt) is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth; if Chriſt Jeſus be the end of the Law, and the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and love the end of the Law, and Commandement, Then the love which is of Chriſt, ſure, or Chriſt who is love, (for God is love) muſt needs be the end of the Law, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; and therefore is ye love me keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.15. (a Text worthy to be thrice mentioned, and repeated.)</p>
                     <p>This is the one onely Text, that you, and I ſhall not differ in I hope, and which you have rightly applyed, and both my ſelf, and all of us, do take to belong unto us, to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to keep his Commandements: yea I adde, if any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Let him be Anathema Maranatha,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. And in teſtimony of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:168478:106"/>our love, we walk in obedience of his Commandements; but I will ſay to you, asit is, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8, 9 <hi>If ye fulfill the royall Law, according to the Scripture, That ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf, ye do well; but if ye have reſpect to perſons, ye commit ſin, and are convincedof ſin, as tranſgreſſors. For he that ſaid, If y love me, keep my commandements, ſaid alſo, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour,</hi> or Brother; and keep that Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo of his, amongſt others; and this Commandement have we from him, that <hi>he who loveth God, loveth his brother alſo,</hi> 1 John 4.21. If a man ſay, as it proceedeth <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>If a man ſay, I love God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and hateth his brother, he is a liar,</hi> (whoſoever the man be) <hi>for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> And again, <hi>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law alſo,</hi> Rom. 13.10. I confeſs, I could now much refreſh my ſelf in this ſweet &amp; roſie Diſcourſe of this point of our love of Chriſt, and our Brethren, after my weariſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling through other ſharp and thorny Diſputes; but I reſolve this Page now in hand ſhall be the laſt, and determine both.</p>
                     <p>Onely I ſhall minde you, that amongſt theſe your Neighbors and Brethren, we the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and taken in, by your leave, Sir; for by his leave, Sir, we are ſo accepted of, to be his Neighbours and Brethren; his Neighbours, as <hi>whom the Lord hath brought nigh unto himſelfe, to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle,</hi> (and Temple) <hi>Number</hi> 16.9. and alſo his Brethren, <hi>For both he that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one; for which cauſe he is not aſhamed tocall them brethren, Hebrews</hi> 2.11. whether ſanctified by Grace from him, or by Office under him; and if he called and owned the Hearers and Doers of his Word, his Brethren, ſure he owneth for ſuch alſo, the Preachers and Doers of the ſame. Yea, ſee how Chriſt Jeſus not onely owneth them for ſuch, but oneth them alſo as himſelf (if I may ſo ſpeak) ſaying, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; he that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me, Matthew</hi> 10.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17. And truly I muſt tell you, that when our People were let alone, and left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and our Miniſters, and before they were befooled and bewitched by you ſeparation from us, as the <hi>Galathians</hi> were
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:168478:106"/>by creepers in amongſt them, they did, as the ſame <hi>Galathians Paul,</hi> receive their learned, pious, and induſtrious Miniſters, as <hi>Angels of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus; Galath.</hi> 4.14. And will do ſo again, (I believe, or hope) by that time they have had a little more trial and experience of your courſes, and ſeen the difference betwixt the new light, or flaſhings of your blazing Comets, and the old light and luſtre of their own fixed Stars.</p>
                     <p>But I give over proving againſt you, or reproving, ſeeing you have given over accuſing of us, and reviling, and are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon love in your laſt line; love, I ſay, and that of Chriſt Jeſus, the moſt lovely Object for a fair concluſion, from thoſe foul Principles of malice in your former lines; malice I ſay, and that againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> and her Miniſters; the leaſt deſerving hatred from you, becauſe ſerving you by love, ſhewed, if not ſaving you by faith, Preached to you.</p>
                     <p>My advice, I know, will ſeem ſtrange and irrational to you in the form of my words and expreſſion; <hi>Forſake your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and leave them, hold faſt your concluſion, and keep it; but it is good and religious, in the matter of ſenſe, and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which is this, <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice, Epheſ.</hi> 4.31. this was your Original ſin, and bad Principles: And again, <hi>Be kindly affectioned one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in brotherly love,</hi> love as Brethren, <hi>be pitifull, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, of one minde, having compaſſion, putting on the bowels of mercies, Rom.</hi> 12.19. &amp; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.8. <hi>Goloſſ.</hi> 3.12.

Though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by reaſon of the larger extent of my Anſwer then I expected, The <hi>Desk</hi> refuſing a tranſcription of
<pb facs="tcp:168478:109"/>it, to which I had offered it, I was even compelled to make my refuge unto the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> for an Impreſſion of the ſame; otherwiſe all the labour muſt be loſt on both ſides, the Queres and Letter unanſwered, the Scribe uninſtructed, the Phariſee uncharged, and Truth unvindicated, as to, and by my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This beingdone, the Anſwer finiſhed, diſmiſſed, and ſent away for the aforeſaid prupoſe, There fell out, and was practiſed in my Pariſh, and (it may be for the more affront to me) at a houſe of mine there, This <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of two new Siſters</hi> in a Pond of the Yard: The which being in <hi>publick,</hi> upon the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Morning and Evening Worſhips, drew away much people thither, and was <hi>diſcourſed</hi> of by many mouthes, and ſo <hi>famed</hi> about in theſe parts, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved (and could do no leſs) to get a full <hi>Narration</hi> of the buſineſs, and to paſs my <hi>cenſure</hi> upon the ſame. And ſo having firſt <hi>preach</hi> it down in my Pulpit to my own Pariſh, as a <hi>New buſineſs</hi> of ill conſequence, I next have <hi>written</hi> it down in my Study, to thee the Reader, and have ſent up alſo, this my cenſure, after the former, my Anſwer, to be <hi>Impreſſed</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed</hi> together, into the ſame Tractate, as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling both of them, matters very agreeable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant.</p>
                  <p>So then here <hi>intending</hi> the Preſſe, and having now no confinements or <hi>reſtraints</hi> upon me, I have taken my full <hi>Liberty</hi> to produce and bring in much of the <hi>Learned Antiquity,</hi> and to write out, and tranſcribe their <hi>weighty</hi> Words and Speeches, in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as many of them as I had by me, for the fuller <hi>Confirmation</hi> and firmer <hi>Attestation</hi> of this my cenſure

                  </p>
                  <p>Yea this I have done, as for the <hi>convincing</hi> the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts their Dipping, and Immerging Baptiſm (ſo called) to be of Novelty; ſo for the <hi>Confirming</hi> the Orthodox, their <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> and Aſperſing Baptiſm (as it is) to be of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> by the evidences of the ancient Fathers and Doctors, brought forth and ſhewed on both ſides: and farther I have aſcended up to the <hi>Higheſt Antiquity</hi> of all, even to the <hi>Ancient</hi> of dayes, and the <hi>Primogenit</hi> of every Creature, and have (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably at leaſt) ſhewed, that Chriſt Jeſus himſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh was but <hi>Aſperſed</hi> or <hi>Superfuſed</hi> with water, and not <hi>Dipped</hi> and <hi>Immerged</hi> under the water (certainly not in their way and manner) at his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, by S. <hi>John</hi> the Prime baptiſt, nor other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, after him, by S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other <hi>Primitive Baptizers.</hi> And as to <hi>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Onely, I wonder at the Iron-brow, and Brazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of novel Impudency, and <hi>New light,</hi> that whereas it is every Seventh day at leaſt, in its Chimney-houſe Conventicles, prating againſt the Old, Laudable, and <hi>Ancient Practices</hi> of this our, and other reformed Churches, it dares pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> (ſo contradicting it ſelf) and glory of it in this point, of <hi>their Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> and <hi>Dipping,</hi> (calling it the <hi>Good old way</hi>) who ſcorn it, and ſcoff at the ſame, and

                  <p>I ſay no more to thee then what <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, 32.7. <hi>Dayes ſhould ſpeak, and multidude of years ſhould teach wiſdom.</hi> And ſo 12.12. <hi>With the Ancient is wiſdom, and in length of days underſtanding.</hi> And laſtly, what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Remove not the Ancient Land-Mark which thy Fathers have ſet,</hi> Prov. 22.28.

                  <p>Now <hi>John</hi> I know, and <hi>Philip</hi> I know, and <hi>Ananias</hi> I know, and <hi>Paul</hi> I know, and <hi>Peter</hi> I know, and the twelve Apoſtles I know, and the ſeventy two Diſciples I know, and the ſeven Deacons I know, that they were <hi>ſervants of the moſt High,</hi> ſent and appointed of God, <hi>to ſhew unto us the way of ſalvation, and to miniſter the holy Ordinances, Acts</hi> 16.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.15. <hi>But who are ye?</hi> Ye that go for <hi>Dippers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>Peter commanded them tob e bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> it ſeems, that together with <hi>Peter,</hi> ſome other Brethren alſo preſent there, either aſſiſted in bringing water, or (it may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168478:114"/>be) in pouring on water, or aſperſing therewith, the houſhold of <hi>Cernelius:</hi> but at the command and call of <hi>Peter,</hi> and God chiefly, who had baptized them before with <hi>the holy Spirit.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they, the Brethren, were ſome ſuch of the Diſciples, who had before an <hi>ordinary calling</hi> to ſuch like work; if not, here they had <hi>extraordinary</hi> to this in preſent.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>John</hi> 1.25. the Phariſees (I wonder how the Scribes hypocrites kept off, for if, as uſually they had been here joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then you and yours had been here fetcht in) in their ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling at <hi>John,</hi> reſolved the point, ſaying unto him, <hi>Why bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeſt thou then, if thou be not that Chriſt, nor Elias, nor that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> And at the 33. verſe <hi>John</hi> ſheweth his Authority, namely his Miſſion; <hi>He that ſent me to baptize with water:</hi> The Baptiſt was of Gods ſending; nay, when <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples came and told him, ſaying, <hi>Rabbi, He that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou bareſt witneſs, behold, the ſame baptizeth, and all men come to him. John anſwered and ſaid, A man can receive nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be given him from heaven, John</hi> 3.26, 27. So giving us a rule in general firſt: No man can (lawfully) baptize, except he be authorized from above, that is, ſent of God. So at 34. ver. he applieth and expoundeth, in the particular of himſelf, as before, ſo here of Chriſt, <hi>He whom God hath ſent ſpeaketh the words of God.</hi> And thus the Author to the hebrews, Chap 5. ver. 4. giveth both the ſame Rule in general; No man taketh this honor unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron:</hi> Alſo maketh the application in particular to Chriſt, ver. 5. <hi>So alſo Chriſt glirified not himſelf, to be made an high prieſt, but he that ſaid, Thou art my ſon;</hi> he ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou art a prieſt, &amp;c.</hi> To circumciſe was a <hi>ward</hi> of the <hi>Legal,</hi> and to baptize, of the <hi>Evangelical Keyes;</hi> and they belonged onely to the Prieſts and Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors in both admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations.</p>
                  <p>So then, ſtill I ask the Queſtion, <hi>Who are ye,</hi> who take upon you (I hope not) to call over them which have evil ſpirits, the name of the Lord, (ſaying, <hi>We adjure you by Jeſus,</hi> yet) to call over them whom ye think to have the holy Spirit, <hi>The name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſaying, We baptize you in the name of theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">§. 1. Your anſwer is, <hi>They are Brethren ſet apart by faſting
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168478:114"/>and prayer of the Church, to adminiſter holy Ordinances.</hi> But if this would do it, that they are <hi>Brethren,</hi> and that they are <hi>ſet apart;</hi> why do ye not all, at times, become <hi>Dippers?</hi> for ye are all ſpearate Brethren, there is but one letter leſs (and as little literature) in a brother <hi>ſeparate</hi> then, or as in a brother <hi>ſot apart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if truly <hi>ſet apart to adminiſter holy Ordinances,</hi> why do they not give over, as in ordinary, their ſecular Trades and Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Callings, and wholly or chiefly tend upon ſuch Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto which they are <hi>ſet apart:</hi> for ſo is both the precept and example of the word you ſo much pretend to. <hi>Separate me Barnabas and Sakl for the work whereunto I have called them, Acts</hi> 13.2. <hi>Give thy ſelf wholly unto them, i.e.</hi> Reading, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Exhortation, and the Gifts given thee, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. <hi>It is not meet we ſhould leave the Word of God and ſerve Tables, Acts</hi> 6.2. and much leſs Stalls.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. If <hi>ſet apart,</hi> by, or of whom I pray? by, and <hi>of the Church</hi> you ſay: and what Church do you mean? ſure your own ſmall private company of Believers; or be you a great publique multitude of them. And now are you not again out of the <hi>good old way?</hi> yes ſure; for Chriſt never gave unto ſuch a Church, no not to the whole community of people Believers, as Believers, any ſuch power and authority, to <hi>ſet apart</hi> a Brother or Brothers, to <hi>admi-iſter the Ordinances of Chriſt,</hi> as Preaching, Baptizing; but onely to ſuch as himſelf choſe out of the Church and believers, to be Guides and Paſtors of the ſame. So of old, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſeme Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> and it followeth, <hi>for the Church its perfecting and edifying,</hi> &amp;c. (not to the Church to ordain and ſet apart) the Authority is Chriſts to give, not the Believers. And Chriſt (of old too) gave the Keyes and the power of them (one part whereof is this ſetting apart of perſons to the adminiſtring of holy Ordinances) to <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles, as bearing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Paſtors and Guides of the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. and not as repreſenting the Church of Believers, (for then theſe alſo muſt have power to binde and looſe in earth and heaven by Cenſures, <hi>John</hi> 20.23. as well as the Apoſtles and Paſtors, and ſo women and children may come in for it, as Believers.)</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168478:115"/>
                  <p>I could never ſee yet, that the Miniſtery of the ſeparation, had any ſeparation to the Miniſtery, juſt and right according to the good old way; onely a kinde of popular Democratical deſignation they have, but no authoritative or official Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is Ariſtocratical. But why do you not ſpeak out to the full? Was he your brother <hi>ſet apart</hi> of the Church? <hi>i.e.</hi> your ſelves the Brethren to adminiſter the Ordinances of Chriſt and was he not alſo authorized to give Orders? (or do you mean theſe alſo orders by them Ordinances) how elſe will you be given to preaching, or be a gifted Preacher ere long, if not already? Nay, when your Church and the Brethren did ſet him apart to the Miniſtery, did not your Church and Brethren give him <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> to the purpoſe, that ſo he might give back again to your Church, and any of the Brethren, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Ordination;</hi> and ſo make yours a very orderly Church indeed, in running round in a ring until you be turn-ſick and giddy-headed. But enought of this, having ſpoken largely of it in the Inſtruction of the Scribe.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Set apart of the Church,</hi> but how I ask? You ſay by <hi>faſting and prayer,</hi> and this was all it ſeems. And why not alſo, by <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> according to the <hi>good old way,</hi> laid open and plain in the Text before cited, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. and tracked or traced by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14, and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p>Thus of old they, the holy Spirit, and the Apoſtles did <hi>ſet apart Brethren to the adminiſtring of the Ordinances,</hi> and this of old, namely the Laying on of Hands alſo, was a note of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring miniſterial power and authority, as a means alſo of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſpiritual gifts and abilities. <hi>Now the things which god hath joyned together</hi> (in the conſtitution and ſending out of a Miniſter in holy Ordinances) <hi>let no man put aſunder, or ſet apart Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Prayer, and Laying on of hands:</hi> none do or will, but ſuch as have a ſpirit of Diviſion and Separation, an humor of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty and Innovation, and therefore I do not wonder at it in you. Beſides, you had no hands to impoſe in ſuch a buſineſs, they are too ſhort to reach up, and to lay upon the head of a Brother, as to Commiſſion or Ordain him, or ſet him apart, as from God, for the ſacred adminiſtration of Baptiſm: you mouths ſhut up by faſting, and your hearts enlarged by prayer, may do well, as to commend and preſent him to God, for his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168478:115"/>bleſſing and confirmation of his graces, when ſuch are rightly and duly <hi>ſet apart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. You have done now with your <hi>ſet apart Brother,</hi> but there is another matter yet to be done according to the <hi>old way;</hi> for they alſo in the 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. ſent away <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> And ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How ſhall</hi> or can <hi>they preach,</hi> or baptize, <hi>except they be ſent.</hi> True St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17.

                  </p>
                  <p>But now you were not in a capacity as to this ſending out of a Brother to adminiſter this or other publique holy Ordinances; as he would not take this honor to himſelf, to be an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, ſo you and your Brethren could not give it unto him, and ſend him forth, for that you muſt be ſent your ſelves, before you can ſend others to go forth into the nations, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Baptizing. So Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 20.21. <hi>As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> In a word, was, or is your Brothers ſeparation to adminiſter Baptiſm, and other Ordinances, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or extraordinary? If extraordinary, then your Church did nothing here, for that is neither of man nor by man; you did not then <hi>ſet apart:</hi> If ordinary, then your Church had nothing here to do, as which it ſelf was never ſet apart, or ſent out from Chriſt and his Authority to ſuch purpoſe. This being not done as yet to you, or him, you may think what you will of your Creature, and admire your Feature; your <hi>Brother ſet apart Dipper,</hi> is ſtill in the eſtate and condition as your ſelves, and as before; he was for any thing you have done, a Brother, but no Miniſter; a <hi>Separate,</hi> no <hi>Set apart;</hi> a Dipper, but no Baptizer; a Lay Teacher, but no lawful Preacher.</p>
                  <p>And I will tell you what <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of ſuch, and I will tell it you in Latine, becauſe you underſtand it, <hi>Si Laicus Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum dederit, null â cogente neceſſitate, alieni muncris eſt uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Parmen. cap.</hi> 13. This I deſire you to Engliſh to your Brother. And becauſe perhaps you were enjoyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your dipping to renounce your Latine alſo as a profane thing, or elſe ſince your dipping, you may have drowned much
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168478:116"/>of your Latine, or drained it from you, I will give you another ſaying of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in Engliſh, in his book of Baptiſm: <hi>To give Baptiſm, is in truth the Biſhops right,</hi> after him it belongeth to <hi>Prieſts and Deacons;</hi> but not to them without <hi>Authority</hi> from him received; for ſo the honor of the Church, which being kept, preſerveth peace: were it not in this reſpect, <hi>the Laity</hi> might do the ſame all ſorts might give, even as all ſorts receive: But becauſe emultation is the mother of Schiſms, <hi>Let it content thee</hi> (which art of the order of Lay men) to do it in neceſſity, when the ſtate of <hi>time, or place, or perſon thereunto compelleth; for them is their boldneſs priviledged that help, when the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of other mens dangers craveth it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both theſe learned and pious Fathers yield, even to a Lay man, ſuch a one as your Brother or your ſelf, to baptize, in a caſe or ſtate of neceſſity; and one of them enlargeth it, To <hi>time, place, or perſons:</hi> I ſhall but gueſs at the particular mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of them, if I miſs, let who can and will rectifie me, I will thank him, for you (I know) cannot if you would</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The caſe of neceſſity in ſtate of <hi>Time,</hi> is when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian party unbaptized is in preſent danger of death, and no lawful Miniſter at hand, or to be ſuddenly procured.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The caſe of neceſſity in ſtate of <hi>Place,</hi> is when Pagans are converted, and a Church there to be planted, and no ordained Miniſter amongſt the Converters.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The caſe of neceſſity in ſtate of <hi>Perſon,</hi> I ſcarce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, unleſs it be this, When as he or ſhe earneſtly deſireth and imploreth for the ſame, whether by its ſpeech, or its need, and there is no Miniſter to give it Baptiſm; here the Lord <hi>will have mercy and not ſacrifice,</hi> and men are not to ſtand upon this ordination, but the perſons ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Let but your Brother, or your ſelf, ſtay and expect ſuch caſes of neceſſity, before you, or he, dip any more, or baptize again, and then though you be not, nor he, ſet a part for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring that Ordinance, but are meer Lay men, you ſhall hear nothing from me againſt the ſame. I aſſure you. But if in a well ordered, and already planted and conſtituted Church, and that when there are no ſuch caſes or ſtates of neceſſity, but that lawfully ordained Miniſters may eaſily be procured, you and your Brethren will go on ſtill to dip and baptize, and that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168478:116"/>publiquely, being no better ordered or ſet a part, then you have related, I ſhall ſay though again, <hi>Ye take too much upon you ye ſons of Gad</hi> (for I ſhall not hold you of the Tribe of <hi>Levi, Num.</hi> 16.7.) or <hi>Iſſachar</hi> rather, <hi>couching down between two burthens, Geneſ.</hi> 49.14. your Laical and Miniſterial Callings.

                  <p>But a Layman, may not baptize publickely but onely privately; neither privately in the preſence of a Prieſt or Deacon, but onely in their abſence; neither alwayes in their abſence, but onely in caſe of neceſſity. Then it hath been permitted (according to the good old way, and new way alſo of true Churches) ſome ſuch times to Laymen to baptize, ſo he intend to do that, which the Catholick Church doth, in that kind of adminiſtration.</p>

This doth not intimate any Repetition or Reiteration of that Sacrament, in, or to the ſame particular Iſraelitiſh perſon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, as if he ſhould be now circumciſed again; but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Reſtauration and Renovation of that Sacrament unto the people of Iſrael in general, amongſt whom Circumciſion was a long while intermitted and diſcontinued, by reaſon of their frequeut, yea, continual journals and removings up and down, as the 4, 5, 6 Verſes do evidence the ſame.</p>
                     <p>As for that <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5. of St. <hi>Pauls practiſe,</hi> &amp; the example of the Epheſian Diſciples in the Acts, it is abundantly anſwered in my Inſtruction of your Scribe, to which I refer you, and I add this for a plainer and ſhorter Reſolution for you, 1. That it maketh nothing for your Re-dipping, and Re-baptizing.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe St. <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm being there ſpoken of, and you or your Sect being Popiſh in your opinion of Re-baptizing, and ſo holding from hence that the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> and Chriſt, are two different Baptiſms, and that in the ſubſtance, and not onely in the Degree of their ſignification and efficacy, Here was no iterat on of one and the ſame, but the miniſtration of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Baptiſm, and ſo is not to your or my purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For that there is no Baptiſm of water ſpoken of, much leſs there laid to be reiterated; (that the Epheſian Diſciples had long before received from ſome of <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples) but onely the Baptiſm of Fire, <hi>i.e.</hi> of the Spirit and the miraculous gifts of the ſame, is there mentioned, which they confeſs they had not ſo much as heard of, namely, that they unſually as then, accompanied the other Baptiſm of water. And ſo that the former was that they were baptized with, and was poured upon them there, in the Name of Jeſus, namely, the gifts of the holy Spirit which were miraculous.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:168478:117"/>
                     <p>If you ſhall produce (as ſomewhat you muſt ſay for your ſelves) the example of <hi>Saul, Cornelius</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> baptized in their elder years upon their converſion to, and cofeſſion of Chriſt: and the commands of God to <hi>Ananias, Peter</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, &amp;c.</hi> to baptize them thereupon: All this, and as much more which you might have alledged of the ſame ſort brings no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to your practice, no age, to your new buſineſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſing the ſecond time: for, that the mentioned above, were their firſt and onely baptizings, they being ſome of them Pagans born, others, aliens from the Covenant of Chriſt, adverſe and oppoſite to ignorant, at leaſtwiſe, of the Chriſtian Faith, were then friſt of all baptized, upon their embracing of it, and never after baptized again. No, not the Black Aethiopian amongſt them, was ever dipped the ſecond time, And what is all this, to your Redipping of two Women baptized before in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as being born Chriſtians and within the Covenant of Grace and Chriſt? Yea more, if the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould come over into <hi>England</hi> and turn Proteſtant, or become one of your Sect, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate; nor we would, nor ſhould you (of right) baptize him again, having been baptized before rightly, as to the Element and Words of Inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Ancient Orthodox Church, never Re-baptized Hereticks themſelves, upon their return and reverſion to the Faith, (who were before baptized; nor the children of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, though baptized by Hereticks, or heretical Miniſters, if rightly according to the Ordinance) but rather condemned it, and pronounced it a Hereſie to hold it, or to practiſe ſo, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization.</p>
                     <p>For the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, there is a <hi>Quotieſcunque,</hi> &amp; it ſhould be received as oft of the ſame Perſon as may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, for that our growth and augmentation in grace, ought to be daily and continually, whereof the Euchariſt is the Sacrament: But I never read of above a ſemel, of the Sacrament of Baptiſm, that it ſhould be received above once, of the ſame perſon, becauſe our Spiritual Birth and inciſion into Chriſt is but once, whereof Baptiſm is the Sacrament. The thing is acted but once, and therefore is ſignified but once.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge indeed that it is no where expreſly written, that baptiſm ſhould not be irerated and received the ſecond
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168478:118"/>time, ſo its no where ſaid, there are three Perſons of the Deity, though the word (of perſons) is no in ſacred Writ, yet the will of God about the things ſignified by the Word, is revealed and expreſſed in the ſame. So, the Will of God, that baptiſm ſhould not be iterated, and once baptized ſhould not be re-baptized, or baptized the ſecond time, appears partly out of what I have alledged.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. That in the very Place and Scripture, where Chriſt inſtituted Baptiſm (which yet had been the very proper place for it) there is no order at all, for re-baptizing, or iterating baptiſm.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That among all the many examples of perſons baptized, There is not one recorded to have been re-baptized, no not <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Sorcerer, nor <hi>Demas</hi> the Revolter, not one of the Corm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians; nor of the Galathians relapſed, but onely were called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Return to the Grace of the Covenant (ſealed in their firſt Baptiſm) by Repentance and Faith.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe the grand reaſon of your re-dipping and re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing in elder age is this, for that you hold your firſt dipping and baptizing to be vain, Invalide, &amp; fruſtrate, which was tranſacted in your infancy (for ſo one of your Sect told me the other day, that when he was a Child he was Chriſtened, but he was then alſo but cozened.) As I warned him, ſo I wiſh you, to take heed unto your wayes that you offend not in your tongue or thought, ſo, as in either of them to reproach the Living God, or blaſpheme his holy and effectual Baptiſm, by thinking and calling this a Cozenage, and him a Mocker.</p>
                     <p>Did God cozen the whole Church and People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when he appointed and commanded their children even but of eitht days old to be circumciſed? how then doth he cozen the Church and people of the Gentils in our Infants baptized, ſeeing baptiſm is <hi>the Circumciſion made without hands,</hi> Col. 2.11. Nay, ſeeing both Circumciſion and Baptiſm are the ſigns, and ſeals of that one and the ſame <hi>Everlaſting</hi> Covenant of Grace; they neither are, nor can be any cozenage or fruſtrate things, to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168478:118"/>the right Partakers of them (until they be fruſtrated by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Partakers, as by <hi>Eſau</hi> was his birth-right, and alſo his circumciſion, and them God is rather mocked and cozened, then a Mocker and Cozener;) but they are valide and of force to the ſpiritual good ends and purpoſes of either; and therefore being rightly once imprinted, are of vigour and vertue, of frait and efficacy during life, and ſo long as the Covenant laſteth, which is everlaſting; (as I ſaid) and ſo need not to be repeated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated, but are often to be revolved, and revived in our mindes, memories and meditation and the Tenor of the Covenant daily to be ſtudied and practiſed, and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof on our part to be obſerved and performed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                     <p>Rather your ſelf, Sir, and your two Siſters were cozeded and cheated (and never ſo much in all your lives as) when you renounced that your firſt Chriſtian Infant baptiſm, and received this your ſecond novel youthful Dippiſm.</p>
                     <p>Nor can that be any good reaſon of your re-dipping or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing, your defect of Faith in the time of your Infancy, or ſithence days of age, your Ecceſs of ſins, ſuch as have vacated the gracious Covenant and vitiated a good Conſcience. For you muſt conſider, that the Covenant is ſealed in Baptiſm, or Baptiſm is added to the Covenant on Gods part as well as mans: God promiſing there Grace and Eternal life, and man ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulating for Faith and new Obedience; Though therefore you might or did fly from the performance of your Promiſe, by Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie or Apoſtaſie, and upon ſuch default on your part loſt your right and claim of eternal life; God notwithſtanding ſtood and ſtandeth ſtill firm to his Promiſe on his part, as who never breaketh Covenant with any, nor ever loſeth his right to any party baptized by any default made on his ſide.</p>

                     <p>For do your think that thd Eunuch, or <hi>Lydia,</hi> were thus, and in this maner baptized of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in the waters clothed, and with their garments upon them; and that to this purpoſe they went aſide in private to ſhift themfelves of the ſuits they had on, and to put on others that they might have dry clothes ready, againſt they came out of the water with their wet ones: ſay not ſo, no, not in your thought, for the Scripture ſaith no ſuch matter, no, nor ſuggeſteth any ſuch thing to thought.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168478:122"/>it is true alſo that the old and late Liturgy of our Church of <hi>England</hi> mentioneth the Miniſters taking the child to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, into his arms, &amp; naming it, ſhall (as the Rubrick hath it) dip it in the water, ſo it be diſcreetly and warily done, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the cloaths, or out of the cloaths, it is not expreſſed. In preſent I think, and ſo ſhall, until I be better informed, that our Church meant a dipping of the Infant out of the cloaths, and therein owned the Antiquity of the practiſe; but yet ſhewed her authority in things of ſuch nature, for that ſhe addeth, if the child be weak, it ſhall ſuffice to pour water upon it, ſo indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the health and welfare thereof: (and what child is not weak, in theſe our Northern cold Clymates?) though not contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Antiquity which did ſo dip children naked in thoſe Eaſtern warmer Countreys, where they might more ſafely do it; I am ſure ſhe meant not your new way of dipping in the cloaths over head and ears, and the whole body.

I omit to open unto the Reader, the packet of theſe other frivolous if not ſcurrilous Rites and Ceremonies which were uſed at this your dipping, ſome whereof you relate, and others, (for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168478:123"/>modeſty I ſuppoſe) you ſilence, but are talked of by the ſpectators, as ridiculous and infamous. I queſtion them not at all, for they were all ſuch, queſtionleſs, onely this I queſtion, How men of ſuch ſincerity onely, ſhould be thus full of ceremony alſo, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo how you, who hate in others, innocent and ſignificant ceremonies in miniſterial celebrations, and abominate them, as the abomination of deſolation, throwing them away as the rags, and patches of Popery, and rending them off, as the fringes and laces of the whore, ſhould now be ſo far in love of them as to clothe and adorn your Dippal adminiſtrations in ſuch offenſive and ſenſleſs Rites, and Ritual dreſſes, ſo that your brother may be better called a maſter of Ceremonies then a Miniſter of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
                     <p>This one thing I ſhall queſtion here, why your brother was ſo quick of his words, and ſo ſlow at his work? for ſo it ſeems by the narration (which is your relation) that <hi>he ſpake the words accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inſtitution; I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, before he dipped them in the water, though but immediatly before,</hi> The which I take to be another novelty, if not more, ſome vanity be not in it.</p>
                     <p>For our Engliſh Liturgy, conſonant to the ancient Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the Churches, doth otherwiſe and better practiſe &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect: where (as the Rubrick hath it) the Miniſter naming the child, ſhall dip it in the water, ſaying, I baptize thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I conceive there is good reaſon for it, that the dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into, or ſprinkling with water, and the pronouncing the words of adminiſtration I baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be done in one and the ſame inſtant of time, as two conjunct Acts, (and not one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other) becauſe the ſign and the thing ſignified are two correlate parts, and go together, not one before the other. If either may go immediately &amp; inſtantly before the other, It is the dipping, before the words, as our Liturgy hath it, (Dip it in the water, ſaying) and not the words before the dipping as your Tympany doth it, (he ſpake the words, before he dipped) nay, there is not verity or truth in it to ſay the words, I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the party be in the water, or the water upon the party.</p>
                     <p>But your Dippers tongue, dipt and tipt (it may be) aforehand for the better keeping out of the cold of water, did run ſo faſt,

What warrant have you of precept, or example of ſacred Scripture, or ſucceeding primitive Antiquity, for your dipping of your Siſters &amp; other your Proſelytes, in Ponds at your Baptizing. This to be done, I underſtand from all preſent there. It was your modeſty and humility not to make any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or mention of it, for that it was your own Pond of your yard, and ſo not to glory of it, that the Dipper ſhould make choice of your Pond, your common &amp; ordinary pond, where your Ducks and Geeſe do waſh themſelves dayly, to honour, it with a ſolemn dipping of two ſpecial Siſters therein at their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeak not this, as if I took exception to common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary water, uſed in Baptiſm; yea, I acknowledge that God therefore alſo made choice of the vulgar and common Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary water to ſet forth, as the purifying and cleanſing of ſouls from ſin, by the blood of Chriſt (which water that waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth doth well repreſent) ſo the general offer and benefit of the grace of Chriſt thereby to all, rich and poor, even the meaneſt and vulgars (which the commonneſs and copiouſneſs of water, every where to be had, doth alſo intimate.) And therefore that queſtion about the neceſſity of water unto bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſo that in decay and defect thereof, there can be no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in wine, or milk, or other liquor, needed not either to have been firſt raiſed, or after ſo hotly purſued by <hi>Hunnius</hi> and his party, for that water is ſo common a liquor as every

                     <p>But yet this I add, that if there be ſuch an invincible want and unavoidable ſcarcity and privation of water for Baptiſm, and wine for the Lords Supper, ſo as to water can be procured, but onely wine may be had, where baptiſm cannot with edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ought not in duty, to be delayed; ſo alſo no wine can be gotten, but onely water, where the Lords Supper can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with edification, and ought not in duty to be delayed, there the one may be ſupplied by the other in each Sacrament; the water by wine in baptiſm, and the wine by water in the Lords Supper. And if there be no affectation of novelty in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no contempt of either of the elements, no neglect of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or acquiſition of the proper element to either, I ſuppoſe, there can be no charge of Hereſie, or breach of inſtitution, in ſuch adminiſtrations, where the peculiar and proper common elements (as I may ſo call them) of wine and water, proper to the Lords Supper, and commonly in uſe, proper to Baptiſm, and commonly in uſe, cannot be had and procured, where ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations ought to be done and performed.</p>
                     <p>If any ſhall here ask what need all this, ſeeing water is every where to be had for baptiſm, and alſo wine for the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I anſwer, either, is not ſo every where to be had, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not a needleſs diſcourſe; for there is no uſe of wine in <hi>America,</hi> where there where brethren that wrote to <hi>Calvin</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, as <hi>Beza</hi> in his 25 epiſtle relateth; and there are beſides a ſort who were, &amp; are, &amp; ſo called, <hi>Abstemious,</hi> who cannot endure the very ſmell or leaſt taſt of wine, but they will ſwoon away, as we ſpeak, and fall down for dead; what ſhall theſe be done to? They muſt either not receive the Lords Supper at all, which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168478:124"/>they cannot well anſwer, if they ask not for it, nor we, if we deny it them; or elſe we muſt give it, and they receive it but in one kinde, (for neither can they away with it, if diluted and mixed with water) and then we ſhall do as the Papiſts would have us, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> propoundeth, as the wiſe way of the Roman Church, to heal up this inconvenience, namely, the withholding of the Cup from ſuch people, (<hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Sacr. cap.</hi> 24.) And how and if the Prieſt alſo ſhould be ſo Abſtemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? its readily replied, none of theſe are ever taken with ſuch a diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>What remains then, but that they muſt and may take this Sacrament in water, or other drink, uſuall and familiar unto them; like as <hi>Philip Malancthon</hi> tells the <hi>Ruthins,</hi> that they may do well to take the ſame in their <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Laſtly, I ſhould not have touched upon this diſcourſe, but that I finde <hi>Hunnius,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and another Jeſuit, <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Gualterius,</hi> courſly handling <hi>Calvin, Beza, Melancthon</hi> hereabouts, whom I ought to defend in the way of truth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three great Lights of the Proteſtant Religion.

(he ſpeaketh of <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi>) I anſwer, Chriſt gave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and the other two, (in the caſes mentioned) and that upon good reaſon. For a good reaſon hereof may be given, that this being the mind and meaning of our Saviour Chriſt,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168478:125"/>by ſetting forth the ſignes of thoſe things by which our bodies are waſhed and cheriſhed (as the water and wine) thereby to preſent our ſpiritual ablution and augmentation by his blood, we do no way ſwerve or go from that his mind and meaning, if without any wantonneſs of innovating in the want of the one, we ſubſtitute another, as wine for water in baptiſm, or water for wine in the Lords Supper, or any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary liquor that may have, though not an equal, yet alike analogy, of waſhing and nouriſhing ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                     <p>By which may be put back what the aforeſaid <hi>Hunnius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth, (as that we have no word of inſtitution, none for ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and whatſoever is not of faith is ſin) all which are blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by our keeping ſtill to the minde and meaning, purpoſe and intention of Chriſt, as to the end and uſe of the elements in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, though the particular elements themſelves cannot be procured. And whereas he puts a man ſo baptized under ſome perplexity of conſcience and under the temptation of Satan (for I will inſtance but in that) (ſee you are not baptized with water, but with ſome other liquor which was neither ſanctified by any Word of God, to this uſe of waſhing away ſin, neither hath it any ſuch promiſe in Scripture adjoined therto) he may be taken out of the ſame tentation, by this anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; That water was ſought out for, and none could be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and he was in danger and extremity of life, and in diſtreſſe and want of Chriſt, and his blood to waſh his ſins away. There being ſome wine in a veſſel in the houſe, a Miniſter affecting no innovation, but his good and ſalvation, and the ſacramental ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſts waſhing blood for his further confirmation and conſignation which he ſo earneſtly deſired, took wine (when he could have no water) and poured of it upon him, uſing the words <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo he may hope, ye doubt not, but God hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him as rightly baptized and interreſſed in Chriſt. If it be ſaid, what analogy in the Lords Supper is there of water to wine, ſeeing this is made up of many bunches of grapes; or in baptiſm, of wine to water, ſeeing this hath a vertue to waſh and cleanſe: I reply, ſuch particular analogies (though they may be profitably thought of where the proper Elements to each Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168478:125"/>may be poſſibly gotten, which are not negligently to be omitted, yet are they not ſo preciſely to be urged, and ſtrictly preſſed the one againſt the other, in the times of the ſcarcity of each (Though if ſo, I can ſay, That the water alſo is made up of many drops of Rain, and the wine hath alſo a waſhing and cleanſing vertue) It is ſufficient that there is here a general ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the teſtifying of our mutual Communion and ſpiritual ablution, as here is, in that we uſe the ſame kind of ſymbols, as drink (and meat alſo) and waſhing, which are common and uſual amongſt us, in defect of the proper and ſpecial, and ſpecially in that we hold one and the ſame faith in, conjunction with, and ſanctification by one Chriſt and Saviour. If indeed, though in a caſe of exigency and ſcarcity of water, any ſhould ſubſtitute or uſe ſuch a matter as hath no power at all in it ſelf to waſh or cleanſe off the filth of the body, &amp; ſo not to ſignifie the blood of Chriſt which cleanſeth from the guilt of ſin, it were to be diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as that <hi>Baptiſmus Arenarius</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Nicephorus, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap. ult.</hi> how that a young man of the Hebrews being deſperately ſick and calling for baptiſm, in want of water was ſuperfuſed with ſand, and miraculouſly recovered immediately; whom notwithſtanding the Biſhop of <hi>Aſcalonia</hi> being conſulted with thereabouts, ſent away unto <hi>Jordan</hi> to be truly baptized; the former baptiſm, being indeed as the houſe in the Goſpel, built upon the ſand and could not ſtand. I know no Hiſtory of a ſandy Supper of the Lord, as I may ſo ſpeak, to parallel with that ſandy baptiſm, as it was called, unleſs it be that <hi>ſucacoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that dry Communion and Supper the Popiſh Prieſts do give to their people; for they alſo as to the one material part of this ſacrament, give them not that which doth and ſhould repreſent the blood of Chriſt, and ſatisfie their thirſt, as who give them no wine, nothing at all inſtead of it; and is it not all one, to give them nothing, and to give them that which doth not, nor can ſignifie the blood, and ſatisfie the thirſt; I am ſure nothing doth neither</p>
                     <p>But why do I thus enlarge I return to you and your Pond water. And here again I muſt tell you, it was a new buſineſs, for the ancient manner of the Church in the pureſt times was to baptize, as out of the Church, ſo in Wels and Rivers, Floods and Fountains, ſo <hi>Walafridus Strabo</hi> ſaith in the 26 Chapter of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168478:126"/>things; For thus Chriſt and all the other multitudes of people were baptized of <hi>John</hi> in the river <hi>Jordan,</hi> as is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid by the Evangeliſts, two of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.13. and 6. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5, 9. and where it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> baptized in water, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>I the rather and at firſt inſtance in this, becauſe the Apoſtle doth himſelf call this a figure or example of our Baptiſm, at the 6. and 10. verſes; for as in that paſſage of the Iſraelites through the Red Sea, they were preſerved, and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the Egyptians drowned; ſo by our undergoing and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Baptiſm, the water whereof repreſenteth the blood of Chriſt to us; our fouls are ſaved, and our enemies, ſin and our natural corruption, are enfeebled and overthrown; ſo, as remitted unto us thereby, it cannot have dominion, or bring damnation.</p>

                     <p>Both of which derivation, and uſe or value of the word, are for the aſperſion and perfuſion of water upon a part, to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by baptiſm, aſwel (if not better) in ſacred Writ, then for immmerſion or dipping of the whole body; yea, the word in its proper and genuine <hi>ſignification</hi> (as well as in its derivation, as I have ſhewed) importeth but an ablution and waſhing with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is ordinarily practiſed and performed in our good and old way of baptizing, and which doth not neceſſarily infer or inforce your new buſineſs of dipping and immerging in, and under the water, the whole body cloathes and all.

                     <p>All this that I hear, is Text, but where is that that is for your Tenet of dipping and immerging? why do you not preſs it, and argue from hence, any of, or all of the three Texts? nay where is any intimation that <hi>any of theſe</hi> perſons were <hi>dipped</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged in any of theſe Rivers?</p>
                     <p>If you ſay, there, where it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt deſcended into the water,</hi> I muſt tell you, that's no where expreſly ſet down, but onely by <hi>conſequence,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>He went up ſtraightway out of the water</hi> (I pray hereafter, you and your brethren, love good conſequences better, and ſtand not alwayes upon verbal expreſſions of the Scriptures for every thing.) It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſaid of the <hi>Eunuch expreſly, That he went down into the water</hi> at his baptizing; but of <hi>Lydia</hi> neither of both is ſaid, but onely that ſhe was amongſt the reſt, and that ſhe was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>by the Rivers ſide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what of Chriſts deſcending down into the waters? If I ſhall argue for you, and conclude hence it is onely this, that therefore it was not now Harveſt time, when <hi>John</hi> Baptized Chriſt and others, <hi>for</hi> Jordan <hi>overfloweth all his banks in the time of Harveſt,</hi> Joſ. 3.15. then they could not have either gone down into, or have come up out of <hi>Jordan:</hi> But you ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for your ſelf, and conclude hence, if you will or can (for I neither will nor can.) <hi>Therefore Chriſts body was all over</hi> dipped and immerged in <hi>Jordan,</hi> under water, over head and ears as you ſay, that followeth not thence; Therefore alſo in his cloaths tyed about him as you do, nor that.</p>
                     <p>More probably, if he was ſo <hi>dipt,</hi> it was in his <hi>naked body,</hi> and out of cloaths, as before I alledged the opinion and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Anſelme;</hi> but moſt likely, <hi>John</hi> did but either dip the head of Chriſt, bending it downward and forward into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (not backward as you do the whole body) or elſe with one
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:168478:133"/>or both his hands did <hi>pour water</hi> upon his head (as he ſtood in <hi>Jordan</hi>) which ran down and wetted his body; and ſo for any thing I can ſee to the contrary, <hi>John</hi> did baptize in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and way, all <hi>thoſe other</hi> that came unto him. And thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Philip</hi> baptized the Eunuch in the River or Water; and thus <hi>Paul</hi> baptized <hi>Lydia</hi> by the Rivers ſide. And ſo this cometh up neer to our manner and way, and ſo it will prove at laſt, the good old way at firſt. But did not <hi>John</hi> baptize in <hi>Aenon, near to Salim, becauſe there was much water</hi> John 3.23. water enough as you think, <hi>to dip and immerge</hi> all the bodies over head and ears; this is but your vain collection: look about the Text, and you may ſee the drift and purpoſe of that, How that there went out to him <hi>Jeruſalem and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him.</hi> Much water was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for ſuch multitudes, though but to lay <hi>and pour</hi> ſome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one, or to <hi>ſprinkle and aſperſe</hi> them all therewith.</p>
                     <p>Again, if he dipped and immerged them over head and ears, in their whole bodies, cloathed as you do, or uncloathed, it muſt have been a <hi>tedious, toilſome,</hi> and over-burthenſome work for <hi>one John Baptiſt,</hi> to have taken them faſt by the cloathes or ſhoulders, and to have laid them down backward in the waters, and to have lifted them up again out of the waters, being now more heavy in their drenched garments, and to have ſet them upon their feet again, ſurely <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt would ſoon have been ſpent that way, or had needed many other Baptiſts under him, <hi>half a ſcore</hi> of ſuch <hi>dippers</hi> as your Brother is, to have aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted him daily and continually, to have diſpatched ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes as daily and continually reſorted to him. Amongſt which great multitudes, that came continually unto him from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> and other Regions about, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think that many <hi>ſickly, and weakly,</hi> and diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hearing of the great fame of ſuch a Prophet as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was, who not onely preached the doctrine of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and of the Meſſias come, or ſhortly to come, but bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of ſin through the ſame, came flocking to him, or were led or brought by others, as deſirous to partake of ſo great a bleſſing and mercy before they departed the world, like as <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.24, 25.

                     <p>But to draw up, if <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was in the River of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> with the people that came to him, how was it poſſible for him to ſtand there in the <hi>cold water,</hi> all the day, and every day dipping and immerging their whole bodies in and under the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? and if he was <hi>out of the water</hi> upon the brink or bank of <hi>Jordan,</hi> how was it poſſible for him, to dip and immerge with his hands, the whole bodies of thoſe and ſo many as came to be baptized? For whereas it may be replyed, that <hi>John</hi> came ſtraightway up alſo out of the water; and therefore he ſtood in the water and baptized there, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.10. if the words of ſtraightway coming up out of the waters, refer not to Chriſt, but to <hi>John,</hi> then its ſpoken of <hi>John,</hi> that he did ſo after the baptizing of Chriſt onely. At the baptizing of others as they came and went away, <hi>John</hi> ſtirred not from them, but diſcourſing many things of Repentance, and Faith in the Meſſias to come, both whilſt he was baptizing them, &amp; afterwards; and ſo before they departed out from him, he inculcated to them of the Faith &amp; of the Fruits of Baptiſm, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10 there is the ſum of his inſtructions to the people ſet down, which becauſe (as he knew) Chriſt had no need of, therefore as ſoon as he had bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized him, he ſtraightway came forth with Chriſt out of the water, and the rather to ſee the Heavens opening, and <hi>the Spirit deſcending upon him like a dove;</hi> and ſo further to inſtruct the people thereupon.</p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:168478:134"/>
                     <p>Again, if the people baptized, were dipped and immerged with their cloathes on their bodies, it was the more heavy, too heavy a work to be done by one; if with their cloaths off, the multitudes coming conſiſting of men and women, &amp; ſome (doubtleſs) weak and ſickly, it was too dangerous a work to be done &amp; too immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt a ſpectacle to be cauſed, or endured, by that holy and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prophet of God. Hereupon my opinion is clear to my ſelf (but with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the naked immerſions of the whole body by the Ancients, cited onely by me, to diſprove the cloathed dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of Anabaptiſts to be the old way) yet not ſo ſtiff, but that it is ready to bend &amp; yield to the ſpirit of the Prophets upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evidence given, that Chriſt &amp; the people baptized of <hi>Joh.</hi> came indeed to the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and into it ſome little way, it may be, or abode in the brink thereof, the people confeſſing their ſins, &amp; ſo <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt from his hands taking up water, <hi>poured</hi> it upon their <hi>heads,</hi> or <hi>ſprinkled</hi> and aſperſed it upon their heads or faces.</p>
                     <p>The which manner of baptizing by aſperſing or infuſing of water, doth yet plainer appear unto me out of the 2 <hi>Acts</hi> 41. <hi>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized, and the ſame day there were added unto them about three thouſand ſouls.</hi> What do you think of theſe <hi>three thouſand baptized</hi> in one day? were they dipped and immerged ſo many bodies, <hi>in one day,</hi> by <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles? how could they, if they had bin together in, or at a River? but where they were, gathered together in the City and in one place thereof, there was neither <hi>River</hi> nor <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> nor Wels, nor Ponds, to be dipped and immerged in, in their whole bodies, neither is there any fyllable of their removing or <hi>going out</hi> of the City to <hi>Rivers or Ponds,</hi> and how then could they be ſo many baptized there, but as I ſaid, by <hi>asperſing</hi> water upon them, or pouring water upon their heads: the very place, and the perſons, the multitude of thoſe who were to be baptized, and the paucity of thoſe who did baptize, do plainly evidence, that the 3000 were not dipped, but aſperſed onely, at that <hi>great and first baptizing</hi> after Chriſts Aſcenſion.</p>
                     <p>No, nor <hi>Lydia,</hi> and her houſhold though by a River ſide abroad, when ſhe was converted and baptized, was dipped and immerged in her cloaths, or out of her cloath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:168478:135"/>or any of theſe cannot be ſaid or thought to be dipped and merged under water, in their whole bodies, cloathed or naked, without great inconveniences, difficulties, improbabilities, if not impoſſiblities, all which are, and may be avoided by the other way of baptizing.</p>
                     <p>And thus, Sir, you may ſee and feel too, unleſs you will <hi>run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to darknes in the day time, &amp; grope in the noon-day, as in the night,</hi> that there is no <hi>footing or bottom</hi> in any River or Pond in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for your dipping and immerging baptiſm. How dare you then cry this up as the onely <hi>good old way</hi> of baptizing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that, and decree it ſo to be, even the very practice of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the very <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>mind</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> when as it never <hi>ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to them, to lay upon us no greater burthen then the neceſſary things.</hi> of which, your immerſion and dipping is none, I am ſure, a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den indeed, but not neceſſary thing, ſure if there had bin, or were any ſuch <hi>neceſſity,</hi> or but <hi>conveniency</hi> thereof, to the perfecting and compleating baptiſm, as that without it, baptiſm ſhould not be true and right as of old, the <hi>wind</hi> that bloweth where it liſteth, and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> that breatheth where it pleaſeth, would in ſome place or other of the Goſpel have <hi>blown and breathed</hi> out unto us ſomething of it; nay rather, hereof is a very great <hi>ſilence</hi> of your dipping and immerging, though much ſpeech and practice of baptizing. Chriſt ſaith as elſewhere <hi>to the winde, peace and be ſtill,</hi> and the ſpirit rather holds in its breath, no words here are made, no <hi>circumſtances</hi> are given, no conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be drawn out for this dipping &amp; diving, putting off or on of cloathes, laying or lying down in the waters of ponds as is uſed by you at your baptizing. But I ſhall now tell you, that the <hi>winde bloweth fair,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit breatheth ſtrongly</hi> and ſweetly, and that of old too, for our <hi>ſprinkling</hi> and <hi>aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> Baptiſm; and I perceive this <hi>ſound from heaven</hi> will <hi>come ſuddenly upon you,</hi> (before you looked for it) <hi>as of a mighty ruſhing winde,</hi> and I wiſh it may fill all the houſe where you and your Brethren are ſitting, and that you would take them, the Texts I mean, into your conſiderations, (unleſs they be all ſpent and ſent away to me in your Brothers Letter, wherein he gave me ſo many conſiderations.)</p>

                        <item>3.

                     <p>Had you Sir, but ſuch a <hi>Quaternion of Souldiers,</hi> as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.4. four ſuch militant Texts to ſtand up and fight

But it is ſo ſtill, and you are at a <hi>loſs</hi> for it, and may be at <hi>alas</hi> alſo for it! you may go light up a candle, and ſweep or ſweat too, and ſeek diligently, and yet not finde a piece of Scripture, one Text for your dipping and immerging into, and under the water, like as I have found out fair texts and pieces of Scripture for our ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and perfuſion of water in the time and act of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing.</p>
                     <p>For as for that Text and piece of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. &amp; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. (which are both one) <hi>that we are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, wherein alſo we are riſen with him;</hi> I know ſome, do <hi>deſcant</hi> and diſcourſe hereout, of <hi>Immerſion</hi> into, <hi>Immoration</hi> under, and <hi>Emerſion</hi> out of the water of baptiſm, but the <hi>Plain Song</hi> in this (as in other) Scripture is this onely, that through baptiſm, being truly ingrafted into Chriſt, and made one with him, we are made partakers of the merit and efficacy of his death, and burial, and reſurrection (for theſe are included in that) to kill and mortifie, bury and aboliſh ſin and natural corruption in us.</p>
                     <p>Though I add alſo this, that ſuch repreſentation and operation of the death, burial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and of us ſinners after his example, is not then at baptiſm required of us, as which is accidental to baptiſm, or ſecondarily eſſential; neither is it primarily nor properly, the inward grace ſignified by baptiſm; but the ablution and waſhing of the ſoul, and cleanſing it from the guilt and filth of ſin in that Laver of Regeneration, is principally intended, and primarily eſſential to baptiſm; like as the putting away the filthineſs of the fleſh, by cutting off the foreskin, was to circumciſion.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, if it were ſo, the burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt, the main thing in baptiſm, yet ſhall we not need to infer hence,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168478:136"/>or to introduce hither the Rite of immerging and emerging, which is your total dipping, as which is reſembled as well and better in our manner of aſperſion and effuſion of water upon the party, though but upon a part, for when water is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, or is laid upon the head of the adult ſtanding on his feet, or kneeling on his knees, as likewiſe upon the face of the child, lying in the Arms of the Miniſter, or the Parent or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſenting it, are they not the while, as it were, buried in, or do they not lie under the water, as the buried doth under the earth? and ſo the party may be ſaid to ariſe as it were, when it comes or goeth from the water, as the body doth from the earth, or the Miniſters dipping his hand into the water, and plucking it out when he layeth it on, may it not have the ſame ſignification with immerging and emerging, and ſo of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Reſurrection of Chriſt? And I think I may ſay, our Church, in giving liberty of dipping or immerging and emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Infants (if not weak) did it not ſo much from <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of this or any other Scripture, as in <hi>conformity</hi> to ſome of the Ancient Chriſtians and Fathers of the Church, in this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, as in other lawful Rites they practiſed, to which and whom I now come.</p>
                     <p>Onely I ſhall give but a tender and gentle touch of one thing that floweth more naturally, or rather more myſtically from the afore-alledged Texts. That if the baptized, his being <hi>buried</hi> with Chriſt in baptiſm, be <hi>repreſented</hi> and ſignified by the <hi>lying and abiding</hi> of the water upon the face or forehead, as a part of the body, and ſo the body in that part thereof, its lying and abiding under the water, even ſprinkled and poured upon it: Then ſure it is not adviſedly and conveniently done by Gentlewomen and tender Mid-wives, to <hi>wipe</hi> off the water from the part, and <hi>abſterge</hi> it with a handkerchief as ſoon as it is laid on by a Miniſter, or by turning the head of the Infant (whom I ſpeak for, that cannot ſpeak for it ſelf) preſently downward, to cauſe the water to <hi>fall off it,</hi> upon the ground. In all the Hiſtory of Baptiſm, from the beginning of it in <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and Rivers to the preſent being of it in Fonts or Veſſels; I do not read of ſuch a word ſpoken, or ſuch a work done, as <hi>abſterging or wiping</hi> off water in Baptiſm; no not then, when there ſeemed more occaſion for it, as when the adult, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168478:140"/>no otherwiſe, then by <hi>taking water out of the Pitcher,</hi> or <hi>Pail,</hi> or <hi>Kettle,</hi> with his hands, and pouring it upon him, even his <hi>head:</hi> and this was much about <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, in year 250. And therefore ſure it was the practice in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time; yea, and it was his very judgement given hereupon, to one by name <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> Epiſt. 76. who propounded the <hi>Queſtion</hi> to him, whether the weak and ſick, who could not be dipt, but were onely <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſi,</hi> ſprinkled or aſperſed with water, were truly Chriſtians, and obtained grace? He <hi>anſwered,</hi> Let it not move any, <hi>quod aſpergi vel perfundi videantur aegri,</hi> that the ſick are <hi>aſperſed</hi> or poured upon with water at their Baptiſm, for that alſo they partake of the Lords <hi>grace,</hi> ſeeing the holy Scripture by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will ſprinkle upon you pure water, and you ſhall be cleanſed from all your filthineſs;</hi> of which Text I have made uſe before to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe I have ſhewed the Antiquity thereof from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomius,</hi> and the Eunomians, who living about the year, 360. did wet the head down to the breaſt, in their baptizing; and I have preſſed it out of the Greek word which <hi>Theodoret</hi> uſeth, who relateth it, that they did it by <hi>pouring</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon their head (thoſe Heretiques imitating therein as their manner is, in thoſe things there is no difference) the Cuſtom of the Orthodox.</p>
                     <p>And yet before theſe, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> who lived about 325. <hi>Orat.</hi> 3. <hi>Contra Arianos,</hi> hath another more expreſs teſtimony, where having ſhewed, that the Arians could not give a true and perfect baptiſm, becauſe they erred in the foundation and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it, as who (though they pronounced the words, <hi>I baptize thee in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt</hi>) believed not in the ſacred Trinity, as who deny the Son, he hath theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But I can bring forth a teſtimony far beyond theſe, for the <hi>Antiquity of aſperſing</hi> or perfuſion in baptiſm, and that is of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> living about the year 190 <hi>lib. de poenit. cap.</hi> 6.

                     <p>And becauſe I have mentioned ſuch a thing, as the Baptiſm of the Clinicks, or ſuch as were converted and baptized in their ſickneſs and death beds, I will put you a <hi>Quaere</hi> upon a ſuppoſition

                        <p>And to do the cauſe and the truth, right, their immerſion was the older way, I ſay not the better way, and is ſome years older then their aſperſion, as many years, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> lived before <hi>Cyprian</hi> which by computation is not above two or three and fifty years difference or diſtance betwixt their times.</p>
                        <p>Yea, but I will recal that Verdict, and do reverſe that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as whereby I do immerſion, and dipping too much right, and aſperſion, and ſprinkling too much wrong, as to their Births, Right and Originals: for I do remember a teſtimony before cited by me out of <hi>Tertullian lib, de poenit. cap.</hi> 6. in theſe words (which may be repeated here again without any Tautollogy, being to ſeveral and different purpoſes and proofs) <hi>Neque ego renuo divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num beneficium (i. e.) abolitionem peccatorum, inituris aquam, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo ſalvum eſſe; ſed ut eò pervenire contingat, elaborandum eſt: Quis enim tibi tam infidae poenitentiae viro, aſperginem unam cujuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet aquae commodabit?</hi> where you read and ſee in plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent words, that <hi>asperſion</hi> of the adult and grown perſons was in <hi>Tertullians</hi> dayes alſo, and I might alſo now paſſe the Verdict, the other way, and ſay, that immerſion and dipping is the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger way, ſome years yonger then aſperſion and ſprinkling, as many years as <hi>Cyprian</hi> is yonger then <hi>Tertullian,</hi> about fifty two or three.</p>
                        <p>The truth then is, They were both of them, as <hi>twins</hi> (as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the womb of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> Gen. 25.24.) as two manners of baptizing in the Church of God, born much about the ſame time, and, (as alſo <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did) they lived and walked together a while, and ſometimes lived apart, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder; and the one was uſed in one place, and the other practiſed in another place, according to the diverſities of the Churches, and difference of the ages, and variety of cuſtoms, in, and amongſt them, and ſo it continued for an eight or nine hundred years.

                        <p>What need I go farther then the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient practiſe was to <hi>dip thrice</hi> in baptiſm, ſo their <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith in the Epiſtle above cited: <hi>Nos autem tertiò mergimus,</hi> and that for reaſons given before; but now it is their maner in baptizing, <hi>thrice to ſprinkle</hi> or aſperſe, for what reaſon they did before; (for none other they have given us) ſo by their later practice rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their former, though their opinion be ſtill the ſame, that the Trine immerſion, is a <hi>nonſcript</hi> Tradition of the Apoſtles, having alike force of Piety with the Scriptures and neceſſary to be obſerved, which if it were ſo, why did they alter from it? their own practice in changing of it, and uſing their liberty, doth refute their opinion of <hi>its neceſſity,</hi> or being an Apoſtolical Tradition.</p>
                        <p>Seeing then there is no <hi>expreſſe precept</hi> for the one or the other, nor Apoſtolical Tradition for the one more than the

                        <p>It is a part of the former <hi>Gregory</hi> his words (in the ſame Epiſtle) worthy notice taking, <hi>In eadem fide nihil officit ſanctae Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae conſuetudo diverſa,</hi> where there is the ſame faith and an unity in it, a different cuſtom in things indifferent, nothing burt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or prejudiceth the Church of God, as which hath power,

                        <p n="3">3 The nature of baptiſm is but this, the <hi>cleanſing</hi> and <hi>waſhing away</hi> the guilt and filth of ſin, by the application of waters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the appointment of Chriſt, ſignifying and exhibiting the blood of Chriſt, that <hi>purgeth</hi> and <hi>purifieth</hi> that way; and all the outward Sacramental actions thereof are but onely to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſet out more lively the inward grace of baptiſm, which is ſtill but the <hi>ablution</hi> of ſin. This indeed, ablution and waſhing of ſin, is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as being of the nature (as I ſaid) and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Baptiſm; for this is called therefore the very <hi>waſhing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by which we are ſaved, through the mercy of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. and ſo <hi>the waſhing of water by the Word,</hi> with which Chriſt doth <hi>ſanctifie</hi> and <hi>cleanſe</hi> his Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. and ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11, <hi>Such were ſome of you</hi> (ſoul ſinners) <hi>but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, &amp;c. in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the <hi>manner and way</hi> of waſhing and ablution of ſin, either that way by dipping and immerging the whole body into, and under the water, or by aſperſion, or perfuſion, or rather ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of water upon ſome part of the body, this is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but as I ſaid <hi>Indifferent,</hi> and <hi>Adiaphorous,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and ſo not of the <hi>eſſence</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> but of the <hi>accidence</hi> and <hi>formality</hi> rather, or ſolemnity of Baptiſm: ſo then if the ablution of ſin,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:168478:146"/>waſhing off the guilt and filth thereof, may be as well (if not better) repreſented by aſperſion and ſprinkling, and pouring on of water upon ſome part of the body, and gently rubbing on the ſame, by the moving of the hand thereupon, as by the <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, immerging,</hi> and plunging of the whole body, into, and under the waters, and holding it ſome while thereunder (as it muſt be.) I add alſo, if it, the aforeſaid aſperſion, or perfuſion, be as <hi>effectual</hi> to the good ſpiritual ends and purpoſes of baptiſm, as the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid immerſion, I ſee no reaſon to the contrary, but that both the ancient and modern, or preſent aſperſion and perfuſion, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of water, is as <hi>warrantable,</hi> and allowable in baptiſm (if not ſtill more) as the ſomewhat <hi>ancienter immerſion,</hi> dipping and diving in and under water: for, as for any ſuch modern or preſent immerſion, dipping or diving under water, as yours is, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it not; <hi>we have no ſuch cuſtom, nor the Churches of God,</hi> as I ſaid but now.</p>
                        <p>It is true, <hi>the body</hi> muſt be <hi>waſhed</hi> and <hi>wetted</hi> with water in baptiſm, either one way or another, and that's enough for the truth and nature of baptiſm; now this may be, and is done, when we baptize with ſprinkling and pouring water upon it, or part of it, and gently rubbing the fleſh therewith, as well as by dipping and immerging: And therefore we do not ſpeak falſly, when but ſprinkling and pouring on water <hi>we ſay we do baptize,</hi> and do not dip (that's your falſe ſpeech, for though we dip not into the water, we lay on water and waſh, and therefore do ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize.</p>
                        <p>Oh but were it not far better, more agreable to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and the <hi>benefit</hi> from baptiſm more <hi>ample and large,</hi> if the <hi>whole body</hi> were dipt and immerged, then onely <hi>ſome part</hi> thereof, the <hi>face, forehead,</hi> or <hi>head</hi> aſperſed and waſhed?</p>
                        <p>This is anſwered already; that our way of ſuperfuſion, or aſperſion with water, is as ſignificant, as effectual as the other, and as ancient within a ſew years, (if any) as the other way, yea, was in force and life, amongſt the Ancients, when the other was dead and gone; and beſides we are freed from it, where we will plead our freedom, becauſe we live <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>Hot Countreys,</hi> where it was <hi>bred and born,</hi> and was to be kept and maintained: in theſe <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the world, where the Churches of God, cannot practiſe or uſe it (I ſpeak of dipping and immerging)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168478:146"/>with <hi>ſafety</hi> to our <hi>Infants healths</hi> and lives. But to the other part of the objection or doubt, I anſwer, and that from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, I gave you but even now four ſeveral Teſtimonies out of four Ancient Fathers and Writers of the Church, how in their times they poured <hi>water upon the heads</hi> of thoſe who were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized; ſo I gave you good probabilities, and more then ſo, of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſts manner of baptizing of Chriſt, and Chriſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (moſt of them if not all) and the great multitudes that reſorted to his baptiſm, by pouring <hi>water upon their heads:</hi> were not all thoſe as <hi>amply</hi> and <hi>ſufficiently baptized,</hi> as thoſe who had their <hi>whole bodies</hi> dipped and immerged under water? and were they not as fully partakers of all the benefits and effects of Baptiſm?</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Ark were the eight ſouls</hi> (the Epilogue of the World, and the Epitome of the Church) <hi>ſaved by water; The like figure whereunto even baptiſm, doth now alſo ſave us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.20, 21. Now then, as the Ark being waſhed with water but in a part of it, whether that which was immerged under the water, or that which was aſperſed with the rain that fell, ſaved the Church then: ſo baptiſm doth the Church now, though but a <hi>part of the body,</hi> as the head, or face; or fore-head be either immerged and dipped, or aſperſed and ſprinkled with the water in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</p>
                        <p>And good reaſon for it, becauſe by and from the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the <hi>Baptiſmal-water,</hi> is bleſſed, ſanctified, and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred</hi> of God and his grace, to be the <hi>ablution and waſhing</hi> of the <hi>whole man, body and ſoul,</hi> though it be <hi>applied</hi> in the out ward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, but to a <hi>part</hi> onely of the body, and ſo received but of a part; it being ſo in this <hi>myſtical,</hi> as it is in ſome <hi>phyſical</hi> ſoveraign <hi>Doſes</hi> and Receipts, which being taken onely at the <hi>mouth,</hi> and into the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> diffuſeth its healing vigour and vertue unto the whole body; though not here in baptiſm by any <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſelf-operation</hi> in this, but a <hi>gracious,</hi> and the ſpirits diſpenſation: ſo then though the water, which in baptiſm is poured onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>fore-head</hi> or face, doth reach to, or flow down to all the <hi>whole body,</hi> in the <hi>external liqucur,</hi> to waſh and wet it: yet in the <hi>internal vertue</hi> and efficacy, which the ſame hath from the Inſtitution and Benediction of God, it extendeth to a <hi>total ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:168478:147"/>of the party baptized, ſo that it goeth <hi>over all, body and ſoul too,</hi> even to an <hi>internal ablution</hi> of the ſoul chiefly, as being principal in ſin, and all this ſtill by the force and vertue of the Divine Ordination of the water hereunto. See it alſo from the <hi>Analogy</hi> that Baptiſm hath with Circumciſion; I know you are never willing to hear of that Circumciſion, but you ſhall hear of that, whether willing or not. In <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> there was but <hi>one part</hi> of the fleſh, <hi>the fore-skin</hi> was touched and cut off with the Knife, yet it was, and is ſo called, the putting away the filth of the fleſh, the <hi>whole body and ſoul,</hi> for that the <hi>vertue</hi> and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of that which was done but to a part, redounded alſo, by Gods appointment, <hi>to the whole,</hi> even to the Circumciſion in <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>ears,</hi> and <hi>lips,</hi> as the Scripture every where ſpeaketh. Now in Chriſt Jeſus alſo we are circumciſed with the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made without hands, in puting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2 11. that is, we are baptized, with the baptiſm of Chriſt, to the waſhing away the ſins of the body and ſoul; and therefore though but ſome <hi>one part,</hi> and the <hi>fitteſt part</hi> the head, or fore-head, or face be onely <hi>externally ſprinkled</hi> &amp; waſhed with the water thereof; yet the baptiſm is valid and effectual to the <hi>ablution internally</hi> of the ſoul alſo, and all the body alſo, virtually ſome way according to his ordination.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly I think not the meaner of our Baptiſm, by reaſon of our but <hi>handful</hi> of water, and our but <hi>ſprinkling</hi> or pouring on of it upon the face and fore-head; or the better of yours, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your <hi>Pond-full</hi> of water, and your immerging and dipping of the whole body therein: No Ordinance of God is to be eſteemed more or leſſe effectual, for either the <hi>more</hi> or the <hi>leſſe</hi> of the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> or <hi>Element;</hi> for God uſually, and more uſually <hi>ſaveth</hi> with a <hi>few</hi> then <hi>many,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14 6. with <hi>little,</hi> then with <hi>great;</hi> that ſo all power might be known to be of him, ſo all <hi>glory</hi> might <hi>be to him,</hi> Rom. 11.36. as who is the God of the <hi>Valleys</hi> as well as of the <hi>Mountains,</hi> 1 Kings 20.28.</p>
                        <p>This is true, eſpecially in myſtical and ſpiritual Ordinances and proceedings, which have his <hi>Inſlitution</hi> and <hi>Benediction</hi> upon them; as I have ſhewed in Circumciſion, and may do the like in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> where a ſmal <hi>portion</hi> of bread, and a little <hi>pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of wine, a <hi>morſel</hi> of the one and a <hi>ſpoonful</hi> of the <hi>other,</hi> are as ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I will onely add to this point a Teſtimony or two of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> writing in his 6 <hi>Homil.</hi> upon the 2 Chapter of the <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> and thoſe words in the 11 Verſe, <hi>In whom ye are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed with the Circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the ſins of the body, &amp;c. buried alſo with him in Baptiſm.</hi> He hath theſe words: <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. I ſhall not ſtand to Engliſh all, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all is this, that both in Circumciſion and Baptiſm, though the <hi>hand</hi> in the one doth but cut off a part of the fleſh, as the <hi>fore-skin,</hi> with a ſmall knife; and in the other, pour on a little <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> but upon ſome part of the body, as the fore-head, the whole body of ſin may be, and in the Elect is cut off (put off in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles phraſe) and waſhed away in both Sacraments, by a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual operation of Chriſt,</p>
                        <p>So alſo for the other Sacraent the Lords Supper, it being one of the Popiſh evaſions for their not giving the wine unto the people, by reaſon of the great <hi>quantity</hi> of wine would be ſpent, upon the numerous multitudes of them, that would then the rather come and drink great draughts (which ſhould not have been thought upon here by them, ſeeing at other ordinary ſeaſts and banquets they ſtand not upon ſuch charge, nor are ſo ſparing of their wine) our Divines tell them (and they ſhould teach their people) that a <hi>ſup</hi> of wine (as a morſel of bread) may do well enough, &amp; as well (if not better) then greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities

                           <hi>Sir, How dare you ſay you embrace the truth laid out by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? did ever Jeſus lay down,</hi> that a man ſhould go to School, and learn his Accidence and Grammar, and ſo to a Scrivener to write a good hand, to cypher and caſt account, commence a ſhop-keeper, or Grocer, and ſet up ſhop, and ſell by the pound Figs and Currens (being never brought up to the trade) in the pariſh, they nilling, willing, to make a living to the value of he knows what, more or leſs, and there ſtile himſelf a Brother and Teacher of Jeſus Chriſt? but this is nothing.</p>
                        <p>Look about you all <hi>Apprentices, How dare you ſay, you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth as it is laid out in Jeſus? did ever Jeſus lay down,</hi> that a man ſhould go up to <hi>London,</hi> binde himſelf to ſuch a Trade for ſeven or eight years, and after a Trade learned, and his years of Apprentiſhip ſerved out, to get himſelf made a Free man, and then to Commence Merchant or Tradeſ maſter;

                        </p>
                        <p>Once more, look about you <hi>Lawyers, How dare you ſay, you embrace the truth as it is laid out in Jeſus? did ever Jeſus lay down,</hi> that a man ſhould go to the Inns of Court, learn the Latine and French tongue, and there read <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Reports and Caſes, and ſo Commence Barriſter and Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and ſo Serjeant of the Coife, and laſtly, a Judge of Aſſize, and ſo take Fees from the Clyents for Cauſes, to the value of divers 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> more or leſs, they nilling willing, and there ſtile himſelf a Councellour at the Law.</p>
                        <p>But why do I intermeddle here? The Narrator or Relator meaneth not me ſure, for that he ſpeaketh of ſome Doctor of Divinity; who might therfore do well to doctrine a little better, yea, and diſcipline the Indoct young-man.

                        <p>Nay, even a Batchelor of Art (to go ſo low;) nay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome Sophiſters of a Colledge (not to trouble any of the degrees at all of the Univerſity, in ſo mean a work) can tell you, and will tell you, in anſwer to your Audacious, bold fac'd, daring interrogations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That as there are in Scriptures laid out by Jeſus Chriſt, orders and degrees of Truth, ſo alſo a Truth of orders and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, even ſuch as are in our Church and Univerſities: See for your learning, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. &amp; 11, 12. <hi>When he,</hi> Jeſus, <hi>aſcended up on high,</hi> he <hi>gave gifts unto men,</hi> (diverſities of gifts) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>he gave ſome Apostles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> or Doctors, (diverſities of degrees) <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come unto a perfect man, &amp;c. Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers or Doctors,</hi> &amp;c? There is that whole Chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, to this purpoſe, to ſhew the diverſity of gifts, and degrees
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168478:150"/>of Officers in the Church, from the foot, hand, eye, head of the natural body, and the diverſity of the parts thereof; inſomuch that the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. <hi>They that uſed the office of a Deacon well, purchaſed to themſelves a good degree,</hi> that is, a Presbyterſhip: and howſoever you think otherwiſe of it, Jeſus himſelf, as he was preſent at the marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee, John</hi> 2.1. to countenance that eſtate and degree of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, ſo he ſate in the <hi>midſt</hi> of the <hi>Doctors, Luke</hi> 2.46. both <hi>hearing them, and asking them queſtions,</hi> whereby he alſo <hi>Authoriſed</hi> that degree alſo, and all other inferior and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate degrees tending thereunto.</p>
                        <p>So it is laid out by Jeſus, both in Nature and Grace alſo, as that one Text ſheweth, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.28. <hi>The earth bringeth forth fruit of her ſelf, firſt the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the car,</hi> and then when the fruit is ripe, <hi>he putteth in the ſickle, becauſe the Harveſt is come.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Are there not mentioned in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62.9. <hi>Men of high degree, and men of low degree?</hi> and doth not <hi>James</hi> bid <hi>the brother of low degree rejoyce in that he is exalted?</hi> Jam. 1.9. Will not you do the like, who are now but a <hi>Brother of low degree,</hi> rejoyce when you are exalted, to be a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and then a Dipper, who is with you; <hi>a Brother of bigheſt degree?</hi> You have been a <hi>Surveyour</hi> in your own Pariſh, and then <hi>Overſeer,</hi> and now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a little better regulated your houſe, may hope to be a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> to rule the Town, and alſo you may riſe to be a <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden,</hi> but that you have forſaken your Church, and the Church, if that will exempt you, and now then, why are you ſo againſt our being Batchelor of Art, and then Maſter, and ſo Batchelor of Divinity; and then Doctor; which are our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Univerſity, like as the other are your degrees of the Countrey.</p>

                           <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> or Temporal Circumſtantial nature, he hath laid them down onely <hi>incluſively</hi> and <hi>reſpectively,</hi> in ſome <hi>general rules</hi> and <hi>dictates,</hi> of good order and comelineſs, upon a juſt occaſion or need, unto edification and for good; and ſo left them to common <hi>Chriſtian reaſon,</hi> and <hi>humane prudence</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake and proſecute according to the ſame: amongſt which things, are thoſe that you except too, education in the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtudy of the Greek and Latine, reading Philoſophy, taking Degrees, Titles of diſcrimination, getting Preferments, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Orders, &amp;c. of which you may read more particularly and largely in my book before, if you deſire to be <hi>a Scribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> in ſuch particulars.</p>
                        <p>Onely I will either add here, or repeat here (fearing you will ſcarce be at the pains (for ſo it will be to you pains) to read it) that the learning of the Latine and Greek tongues (you might have put in the Hebrew too, if you had been a true Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite) and the ſtudying of Philoſophy, and other Arts and Sciences, and the taking of the ſeveral Degrees (which are the honours and <hi>garlands</hi> of the Univerſities, which they give to <hi>Proficients</hi> accordingly, to make them firſt <hi>Students,</hi> then <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates</hi>) all theſe are very uſeful and beneficial, not onely as the preſent aliments and <hi>encouragements</hi> of thoſe Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but thoſe Arts, and Sciences, and Languages, are good <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications</hi> of the underſtanding, and the enabling of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> yea, and of <hi>Faith</hi> too, to encounter with Atheiſts, Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, ſtrong preparatives to the expounding of the Text of Scripture, being written in two of thoſe Languages, and a fuller <hi>qualification</hi> unto the work of the Miniſtery, to do it ſo as not to be aſhamed through ignorance, and ſay the book is ſealed and he cannot read.</p>

                        <p>But particularly for the learning of the <hi>Greek and Hebrew Tongue,</hi> did not Jeſus lay down, that a man, I mean an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter and diſpenſer of the Scripture, ſhould learn them? he laid it down in the whole Scripture, for that he cauſed the whole Scriptures to be written in thoſe original Languages: beſides that, the Title and Superſcription which <hi>Pilate</hi> wrote, and put on the Croſs <hi>(Jeſus of Nazareth the King of the Jews) was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Hebrew, and in Greek, and in Latine,</hi> John 19.19, 20.

                        <p>Yea, and uſually the grace of God doth firſt enlighten the ſoul, and teacheth it the knowledge of the Truth, before it pluck him from his wicked wayes; as in the Prodigal, and <hi>Saul</hi> more apparently. <hi>There ſhined round about him a light from heaven,</hi> and a <hi>voice thereout</hi> taught him the knowledge of the Truth, even Jeſus, whom he perſecuted in ignorance and ſo <hi>there fell from his eyes immediately, as it had been ſcales, and he received forthwith his ſight;</hi> and ſo after <hi>aroſe and was baptized,</hi> Acts 9.3, 18. and became a new creature and was plucked out of his evil and wicked way, of perſecuting Chriſt in his members, and became a member of Chriſt himſelf; but whether it be the ſanctifying grace of God, or but the reſtraining grace of God, the Evangelical tidings, or legal terrors, and faith Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>James</hi> 3.17, 22. or the fear <hi>Jamaica</hi> put you in, I rejoyce to ſee you pluckt out of your wicked wayes, and ſhall much more exceedingly be gladded when I ſhall ſee you alſo brought to the knowledge of the Truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. and becauſe I cannot <hi>in meekneſs inſtruct</hi> you, oppoſing your ſelf, for withal you abſent your ſelf, yet I will pray <hi>that God would give you repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth.</hi> Yea, <hi>moreover, as for me, God forbid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you, but I will teach you the good and the right way,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23.

                        <p>§. Nay Sir, you not onely wrong your ſelf a Chriſtian, and my Chriſtian Pariſhioners, but you <hi>injury Chriſt himſelf, and the Grace of Chriſt,</hi> appearing both in them, and your ſelf, to the plucking of your ſelf and them, from their wicked wayes, to the knowledge of the Truth, (I can be a better witneſs for them, then yoiu, who are but herein, <hi>the accuſer of the Brethren</hi>) <hi>for the Seal of my Miniſtery are they,</hi> many of them, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> I can truly ſay with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2. I ſay again, you wrong Chriſt himſelf, and the Grace of Chriſt, and the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of his Grace, and the <hi>Seals</hi> of his Covenant, Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper, and the fruits and effects of his Seals, and the Spirit of God that daily wrought and brought forth ſuch fruits and effects in their lives. And laſtly, you wrong <hi>your own eyes</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> that will not ſee and acknowledge this, by your ſtiling your ſelf not ſo good, and my people no better then dogs, till you and they came out of your, and their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wayes, to the knowledge of the Truth.</p>
                        <p>What ſay you then to the <hi>children of Iſrael,</hi> and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? by your ſpeech and reaſon, they muſt go for <hi>dogs too,</hi> as not yet plucked out of their evil wayes, to the knowledge of the Truth? but in the <hi>phraſe,</hi> and <hi>language</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> they were a <hi>holy people,</hi> and their children not unclean, but holy; <hi>The Root holy,</hi> and the Branches likewiſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. and that by reaſon of the Covenant of the holy God, and the Seals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, with the other Ordinances; and even <hi>Saul</hi> in the Acts of the Apoſtles, was no dog, but a choſen veſſel of Chriſt, before the Grace of God appeared, plucking him out of his wicked way, to the knowledge of the Truth. Yea, thus you <hi>wrong all the Elect of God,</hi> for Gods Elect, as <hi>Saul</hi> and your
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:168478:158"/>ſelf (it may be) may live in wicked wayes, and be ignorant of the Truth, a long while, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, (and you ſay of your ſelf that you did) yea, the <hi>Elect Epheſians,</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>children of wrath</hi> by nature, as well as others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. and yet were not, nor could be called <hi>dogs,</hi> notwithſtanding impure or hateful before God, becauſe they were in and <hi>under the love of God,</hi> which is called <hi>Amor Benevolentiae,</hi> the love of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good Will and Benevolency in electing of them, although before their Converſion, and before they have Faith, they do not ſtand actually reconciled unto God, which is called <hi>Amosr Complacentiae,</hi> the love of his ſpecial delight and complacency in accepting of them, by the coming of Chriſt into the world, and purchaſing it for them: ſo that their <hi>perſons</hi> are never hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or deteſtable, but beloved and accepted from all eternity, and therefore cannot be as bad as dogs; though <hi>their ſtate</hi> wherein they are in, may be odious and deteſtable, as was <hi>Sauls</hi> when he perſecuted the Church, and as was yours when you walked in wicked wayes, and both of you were ignorant of the Truth: but this ſome <hi>ſimilar act</hi> or <hi>quality</hi> of a dog, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity and ignorance for a while, is not enough or ſufficient to impute the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>denomination</hi> of a dog to ſuch, whoſe perſons belong to Gods Election, and are under gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God in a Chriſt, and are parties covenanted with, and partakers of the Seal or Seals: <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> 1 Cor. 9.9. <hi>what Dogs, who are Gods?</hi> what a tranſpoſition of letters is this? what an <hi>Anagram?</hi> which none but an <hi>Ingram</hi> and <hi>Agrammatical</hi> man, who is himſelf tranſported with a zeal without knowledge, can or will affirm or make.

                        <p>The ground of your error lyeth in this, that you thought of no other Grace, but that of <hi>ſanctification,</hi> when you ſpake thoſe words, of your ſelf and others, to be <hi>dogs,</hi> until the Grace of God appearing, plucking you out of your wicked wayes, to the knowledge of the Truth, ſo the words themſelves do ſhew, and therby ſhew alſo your ignorance of the Grace of God, both
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:168478:158"/>that of Election, and that of Juſtification, which is not any inherent Righteouſneſs and quality, as Papiſts alſo hold with you, which in matter of Juſtification or Election, is but dung, as the Apoſtle calleth it, for the Grace of God is one of his <hi>Attributes,</hi> out of us, <hi>in God,</hi> and according to the uſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is either <hi>metonymically,</hi> the ſpecial gift of Grace, or <hi>properly,</hi> the gracious favour of God in Chriſt, by which Grace, we are elected, called, juſtified, ſanctified, and ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and in this order they go one before another, as ſeveral acts and degrees of Grace, <hi>ſanctification</hi> being the <hi>end</hi> or effect, as of our Election, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. and of our <hi>Juſtificaiton, Luke</hi> 1.75. ſo of our <hi>Vocation,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.7. Its a ſtrange error of yours, to account your ſelf and others a ſheep onely in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Grace of ſanctification; ſo you ſay, you were no better then a dog, till the Grace of God plucked you out of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil wayes; were you then a <hi>dog</hi> and no <hi>ſheep</hi> in and under the Grace of Election, and Vocation, and Juſtification?

They in the mean time reap that, they beſtowed no labour upon: I laboured with you, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into my labours, and have gotten you out of my hands,

                        <p>But fourthly, Is this all, Sir, that you new Teachers and Converters have done for you, and is this all the Grace that hath appeared to you, for to pluck you out of your wicked wayes, to the knowledge of the Truth? Nay, they have not done all this, for they have not brought you to the knowledge of the Truth, but of their Errors: they have pulled you from knowledge to ignorance, and from the truth to falſities, and lyes, as the Scripture phraſeth ſuch, and I will tell you preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the particulars; but ſuppoſe it a while, they have pluckt you <hi>to the knowledge of the Truth,</hi> that's enough to prove you a true Convert by them, for <hi>Judas</hi> was pulled up ſo far as to the knowledge of the Truth, yet proved an <hi>Apoſtate</hi> at laſt for all that, and was an Hypocrite in the mean time; if you be not plucked up farther yet, namely, to the <hi>love</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> God may ſend you (as in preſent he doth) <hi>ſtrong deluſions, that you</hi> ſhall <hi>believe a lye and be damned,</hi> 2 Theſs 2.11, 12. Yea, and yet farther, to the obedience and practice of the Truth, elſe you may miſs to be bleſſed in the end: for, <hi>If ye know theſe things, bleſſed are ye if ye do them,</hi> John 13.17. <hi>Many ſhall ſay unto me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy Name? yea, and in thy Name caſt out devils? to whom he will profeſs,</hi> even to ſuch Profeſſors, <hi>I never knew you; depart from me ye workers of iniquities,</hi> Mat. 7.22, 23. Oh, but you are alſo plucked out of your wicked wayes too, Oh, but Grace of God hath appeared in that alſo. But neither is that ſufficint to ſhew your Converſion by them, for, <hi>Ahab hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf, and went ſoftly, and abſtained ſelling himſelf unto ſin</hi> a while, at the rebukes of <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 King. 21.29. and <hi>Herod</hi> reformed ſomewhat, <hi>and did many things at the preaching of John. and heard him gladly,</hi> Mark 6.20. and <hi>Eſau</hi> mourned for his loſs and ſale of his birth-right, and ſought the bleſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that carefully with tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. If you ask what more would I require, <hi>what lacketh yet?</hi> I anſwer to you
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168478:160"/>as our Saviour Chriſt did to the <hi>young-man,</hi> Mat. 19.20. (for neither are you too old, if you be not too cold to learn) ſaying much as you do, (<hi>All theſe things</hi> do I now <hi>keep,</hi> though not <hi>from my youth up;</hi> the Grace of God hath now in my elder years appeared, plucking me from my wicked wayes.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>One thing is lacking,</hi> and if you wilt be a perfect Convert, find the way <hi>to change your minde</hi> (as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> addeth) and not onely to alter your courſe, and <hi>turn to the Lord with all your heart,</hi> and ſo order that your <hi>ſoul and ſpirit</hi> may be <hi>waſhed</hi> from evil luſts, and not onely <hi>the body and cloathes</hi> dipt from wicked works.</p>
                        <p>But you add, <hi>The day will diſcover, and God will judge between us and you, whether you own the Truth,</hi> to which and whom therefore I leave you.</p>
                        <p>§. I proceed to a ſit thing, which is this, That whatſoever good thing is wrought in you (ſeriouſly and unfeignedly, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congratulate it, whatſoever it be, and would be inſtrumental unto the growth and increaſe thereof, in the way of the Word of Truth:) let the Grace of God that hath appeared to you, have the glory of it, not unto them; not unto them, your (<hi>new Land</hi> Teachers) and <hi>new Pond Dippers,</hi> but unto the name and Grace of God, give the glory, of whatſoever Converſion is wrought in you. If you do not, then with <hi>David</hi> I will ſay, <hi>Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory, for thy Mercy and Truths ſake,</hi> Pſal. 115.1. They have pluckt you onely from the <hi>good old Way,</hi> into a <hi>new, by, and bad path:</hi> from the publick Miniſtery or <hi>Steeple-houſes,</hi> (be it ſo) to private <hi>myſteries or ſmokeries,</hi> rather of their <hi>Chimney-houſes,</hi> from your <hi>firſt</hi> true <hi>Baptiſm</hi> at a <hi>Font.</hi> to a <hi>ſecond vain Dippiſm</hi> in a Pond. They have been rather inſtrumental to your Confuſion then your Converſion. Yea, I ſay further, God doth not uſe them, the Anabaptiſts, as Anabaptiſts, andtheir doctrine as any <hi>ordinary</hi> means or inſtruments of his, to the <hi>Converting</hi> fouls to the Faith and Truth.</p>
                        <p>I promiſed to give you a <hi>Particular</hi> of them, and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and this it is, wherein they <hi>differ from us,</hi> and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the <hi>Truth</hi> of our Church, and the <hi>Word</hi> of God, and which doth <hi>denominate</hi> and conſtitute an Anabaptiſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>They reject all Infant-baptiſm, renouncing their own Baptiſm

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That there is no diſtinction betwixt Clergy and Laity.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>That the taking of Oaths before, or by the Authority of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, is unlawful.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>Are ſuch <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Tenets,</hi> like to pluck you out of your wicked wayes, and to bring you to the knowledge of the Truth, whether private or publick, who hang ſo faſt in the <hi>Buſhes and Thickets</hi> of Errors, and ſtick ſo deep in the <hi>Buſhes and Thickets</hi> of Erros, and ſtick ſo deep in the <hi>mire</hi> of Vices, <hi>dipt</hi> in both up to the <hi>chin and mouth,</hi> yea, <hi>over head and ears,</hi> eſpecially, ſeeing ſuch were never <hi>called or ſent</hi> about the work of Converting ſouls to <hi>either.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For my part, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I am of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and ſo ſhould you be of both too, the Apoſtle and the Prophet. But firſt, I am of <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, who ſaith, indeed <hi>Faith cometh by hearing,</hi> for <hi>how ſhall they believe in whom they have not heard?</hi> But it is hearing of a Preacher; for <hi>how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> And it is of a Preacher <hi>ſent,</hi> for <hi>how ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle is clear of the opinion, that <hi>onely ſent Preachers,</hi> who have <hi>Miſſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from God, can bring hearers to the Faith, and ſeems to wonder at thoſe in his vehement and frequent Interrogatories, who ſay or think otherwiſe.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:168478:163"/>for that indeed a notable change and alteration hath been wrought in you, is manifeſt to all them that dwell here abouts, and we cannot deny it; my ſelf, (as I have ſaid) rejoyce at it, yea, and <hi>the Angels in Heaven rejoyce over one ſinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and converteth</hi> truly and ſincerely.</p>
                        <p>This therefore I will ſay, even the ſame ſtill that you do, <hi>That the Grace of God appeared, plucking you out of your wicked wayes, to the knowledge of the Truth;</hi> But I ask as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3. This onely would I hear and know of you, Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of the Faith; ſo received you this Grace, or your Converſion of being <hi>pluckt out of yoru evil wayes, to the knowledge of the Truth,</hi> from the Word preached by your Brethren of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or from the Word preached by my ſelf, or other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſters? I have proved before, that <hi>unſent Teachers</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> ſhall not, and cannot profit you with their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, eſpecially being not of God and his Word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have not wrought any ſuch thing in you by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and that you could not, cannot attain, and therefore have not attained to Faith, but by hearing of a ſent and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Preacher, and the Word of God by him.</p>
                        <p>Again, received you this Grace of God, or your Converſion and plucking out of your evil wayes, from the Spirit of God, in and by your <hi>laſt Dippiſm,</hi> or your <hi>firſt Baptiſm?</hi> not in and by your laſt dipping at <hi>Laver,</hi> for this requireth <hi>Converſion,</hi> and Faith, and Profeſſion of it, <hi>before</hi> you can be partaker of it; you muſt bring theſe with you, already wrought to your <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> your <hi>dipping</hi> doth not work them at that time, but <hi>preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth</hi> them: ſo, I cannot call your dipping a <hi>Laver</hi> of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> but a <hi>Generation</hi> of I know not what, at <hi>Laver,</hi> or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Beſides, I have ſhewed this your dipping, which is but a Re-baptizing at the beſt, to be a <hi>humane device,</hi> yea, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical practiſe; ſo eſteemed, and for ſuch condemned, of the Churches of God, throughout all Ages; and therefore it can be <hi>no means or inſtrument</hi> of God and his Grace, <hi>to pluck you from your wicked wayes, to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whither now Sir, will you go? as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. ſo is yur caſe; <hi>She ſhall follow after her Lovers, but ſhe ſhall not overtake them, and ſhe ſhall ſeek them, but ſhall not finde them; then ſhall ſhe ſay,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:168478:163"/>I will go and return to my firſt Husband, for then was it better with me then now.</hi> Follow not therefore after thoſe your <hi>Suitors,</hi> and Solicitors, rather your <hi>inveiglers</hi> and <hi>beguilers,</hi> that rather have <hi>tempted</hi> your <hi>ſpiritual</hi> chaſtity, and attempted alſo, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what upon your body, but come and return to your firſt <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, and your <hi>firſt Covenant</hi> of Grace, ſealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you in your firſt Baptiſm, from which, as from the <hi>Fountain,</hi> hath iſſued out all other Grace of God appearing to you ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence; and even that, <hi>plucking you out from your wicked wayes, and bringing you to the knowledge of the Truth,</hi> through his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing his word, and your hearing the ſame of Gods Miniſters <hi>ſent</hi> to that purpoſe; and through the operation of his Spirit, ſtirring up the Grace of God in you, and the Grace of the ſame, ſanctifying your afflictions, and laſt ſickneſs, and fears, and other things that have befallen you. <hi>She did not know that her firſt Husband gave her Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, and multiplyed her ſilver and gold, which they prepared for Baal,</hi> Hoſ. 2.8. or (as in the margent) wherewith they made <hi>Baal.</hi> And ſo you do not, or did not know, that Gods firſt Covenant of Grace in Chriſt <hi>(I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed,)</hi> ſealed unto you in your Infant-baptiſm, your firſt Infant-baptiſm ſealing unto you the Covenant of the Grace of God in Chriſt, gave you your knowledge of the Truth, your Converſion from your evil wayes, your Repentance, your Faith, and increaſed theſe and other Graces in you, which you and they <hi>prepare</hi> for, and aſcribe to their and your Anabaptiſm, and wherewith they and you would make Anabaptiſm, leaping upon the Altar that they have made, and douſing in the <hi>Ponds</hi> that you go to, crying, <hi>O Baal hear us,</hi> or, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians, the dipping of the Anabaptiſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Why halt ye,</hi> or how long, O ye people, <hi>halt ye between two opinions,</hi> or two Baptiſms? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21. if your <hi>firſt Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm,</hi> be the Seal of Gods Covenant of Grace to you, <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it;</hi> but if the Anabaptiſts <hi>ſecond Dippiſm,</hi> be the Seal, then <hi>follow it.</hi> Therefore I ſay farther to them, the people and you; not <hi>I, even I onely, but we, even we alſo, thouſands</hi> of us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Lord, and your Prophets are a great <hi>many more;</hi> (for every one that will with you, may conſecrate himſelf, and be a Prophet) we, as we do, will ſtill bring our
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:168478:164"/>children and Infants of believing Parents, unto Baptiſm in our Churches, pouring on, or ſprinkling water, <hi>In the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt,</hi> with invocation or calling on the Name of the Lord; and do you, as you uſe, go out with your grown, but born Chriſtians, men and women, whom you have with-held from their Baptiſm in their Infancy, or with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grown perſons formerly baptized, whom you have ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into your by-wayes, and carry them to your dippings, and diving them over head and ears, body &amp; cloathes, in your Ponds of the field; the Baptiſm or waſhing, that <hi>anſwereth by fire,</hi> I mean <hi>the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.24. and ſpiritual Graces, bringing after to Repentance from evil wayes, and unto the knowledge of the Truth, let that be the right waſhing and Baptiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: All the people (I know) will, and yur ſelves alſo muſt needs anſwer, <hi>The word is good,</hi> and <hi>it is well ſpoken.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now then I propoſe, and its my major propoſition moſt true, That waſhing with water, or Baptiſm, which anſwereth by fire, (cavil not at the phraſe, God, in or by Baptiſm I mean) and hath the Graces of Gods Spirit, Faith, Repentance, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, anſwerable and following thereupon, is that, and that onely, which is mentioned in the Scriptures, as of Gods Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſo conjunction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>John</hi> 3.6. and in a great many other places, which formerly I have brought, ſhewing the correſpondence or accompanying the one of, or to, and after the other, <hi>the Baptiſm and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I aſſume, and it is my minor propoſition, yet no leſs true, That neither of your two dippings, (I call them two, in reſpect of the Subjects, which are of two ſorts, ſome formerly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſome not) are to be found in any part of Scripture throughout the whole Bible, either inſtituted of God, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with fire, or the Spirit, as my whole Book, and this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed Treatiſe or Cenſure, hath cleared demonſtrated.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I may conclude Negatively, againſt your dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Anabaptiſts, that it anſwereth not by fire, and ſo you have received from them and it, nothing but <hi>water;</hi> no fire, no Spirit, no Grace, no Regeneration, no Converſion, no <hi>plucking out of your evil wayes into the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> What you have of theſe Goods or Graces in preſent, you have and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:168478:164"/>received as ſparks, at your firſt Baptiſm in your Infancy, which being according to the Scriptures, and to Gods Ordinance and Inſtitution, anſwereth by Fire in all Gods elect children, as who are inwardly alſo baptized of the Spirit, whch is the fire I mean and ſpeak of; which anſwering alſo by fire in them afterwards, ſheweth their Baptiſm in Infancy, to have been according to the Scripture, Gods Ordinance and Inſtitution.</p>
                        <p>To come up yet cloſer to you.</p>
                        <p>If you, Sir, be one of thoſe that belong unto the Election and Covenant of Grace, as I in charity judged of you, as I ought to do, when I baptized you, and gave you Baptiſm, as the ſeal of the Covenant, then were you baptized with <hi>fire, i. e.</hi> the Spirit, <hi>as well as water;</hi> the inward Grace being united to the outward Sign unto ſuch, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> as truly, and really, and actualy applying the merits and blood of Chriſt, in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying and ſanctifying vertue, unto your ſoul, as I did the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to your body, or bodily part of your face or forehead; and the inviſible Grace of the Sacrament was conveyed to you by ſuch viſible means; ſo that if you had dyed in your Infancy, this your Baptiſm had been to you (ſuppoſing you ſtill an Elect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant) as a ſeal of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, extraordinarily applied by the holy Ghoſt, to your Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
                        <p>God hath now ſuffered you to live to years of diſcretion, I muſt therefore <hi>put you in remembrance that you ſtir up the gift</hi> or Grace <hi>of God, which is in you,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. (I cannot ſay by the putting on of my hands, but I may) by the pouring on of that water with my hands. The word in the original is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, to ſtir up that fire of the Spirit I ſpake of, and to quicken up the grace of Baptiſm that hath lien <hi>under the aſhes</hi> throughout your youthful and ſinful dayes of ignorance, that ſo now it may <hi>kindle</hi> and burn brighter in you. You are now to beſtir your ſelf in reading the Word, and hearing it preached by ſuch Miniſters as God <hi>ſendeth</hi> into the Church; and amongſt them, him eſpecially who baptized you at firſt, that ſo you may come to Faith by ſuch means, and by Faith now, actually lay hold on the promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, touching, Juſtification, Remiſſion, and Adoption, and <hi>enjoy them</hi> to your <hi>uſe and comfort,</hi> which were but <hi>made and ſealed</hi> in your Baptiſm, as to every <hi>Elect</hi> Childe of God, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:168478:165"/>eſtated upon you on Gods part as to your <hi>Right and Title;</hi> I do not ſay, that your Baptiſm properly did give you, or prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, the Right and Intereſt you have unto God and Chriſt, (Gods free Covenant and promiſe did it) but it ſealed up one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and mainly confirmeth that <hi>Right and Intereſt</hi> which you had already, even then in Gods Govenant and Promiſe: Gods Word is as good as his Bond, and his Promiſe as effectual as his Seal: your Baptiſm (as the other Sacrament) was not for the ſtrengthning or effectualizing of Gods Covenant, but to the confirming and ſupporting your faith in apprehending it.</p>
                        <p>I would make this very plain to you, hoping it may be for ſome good to you. Suppoſe an Eſtate made over unto you in your Infancy, by a Will and Teſtament under Seal, you have not indeed during your <hi>minority,</hi> any ſenſible uſe and benefit thereof, becauſe of your incapability, but yet the Right and Title is not vain, but true and real, and ſtands firmely ſecured unto you to be claimed, and enjoyed to your uſe, good and benefit, what time ſoever you come to be capable of it; ſo that you ſhall not need to look after a new Will, or ſealed Conveyance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the firſt being in force and effectual: Even ſo, God by <hi>Will and Covenant</hi> hath made over, as it were, Chriſt with all his Merits, Righteouſneſs, and all Graces accompanying Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, as ſtill ſuppoſed an <hi>Elect child,</hi> born of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in thoſe words, <hi>(I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed)</hi> and ſealed the ſame in Baptiſm unto you, and you have made little or nothing of it for a long while, as to <hi>your comfort and benefit</hi> thereby, by reaſon of your uncapableneſs of them, by your ignorance and want of knowledge, faith, &amp;c. yet your <hi>Right and Title</hi> to Chriſt and all his Merits, was and is, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>real,</hi> and ſtood, and ſtands firmely ſecured unto you, and ſealed in your Baptiſm, and whenſoever you come to underſtand what grant God hath ſealed to you in Baptiſm, and do actually lay hold upon by Faith, and reſolve to come out of your ſins, as it ſeems lately; and you ſay, <hi>(The Grace of God appeared, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to the knowledge of the Truth, and plucking you from your evil wayes)</hi> then you may lay claim to them all, and ſhall have the <hi>comfortable benefit,</hi> and finde, and feel the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual fruit of your Baptiſm, ſo that you needed not have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out after <hi>another new Will</hi> or Covenant, or another <hi>new Seal</hi>
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:168478:165"/>of the ſame Covenant (the old being ſtill in force and in effect) to the ſlighting of God in his own Ordinance, and to the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of a new Buſineſs; and ſo in a maner, ſetting <hi>your poſts to Gods poſt,</hi> Ezek. 43.8. and ſetting <hi>altar againſt altar, yea, Baal before God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Is it not, becauſe there is not a God in Iſrael, that thou ſendeſt to enquire of Baalzebub the God of Ekron?</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.6. so was it not becauſe there was no <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in our Church, or your bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of our Church was not (as you thought) in force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, that you ran out to the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> to be <hi>dipt</hi> and <hi>laver'd</hi> in a Pond, or to be <hi>ponded and plunged</hi> at Laver?</p>
                        <p>This indeed was occaſioned through great ignorance and profaneneſs in part, that you had ſo <hi>mean and baſe opinion</hi> of the outward Sign and Seal of your Infant-baptiſm, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy thereof, as if it were a meer myſterial <hi>Ceremony</hi> and ſacramental <hi>Complement</hi> for the preſent time, to give the Childe a Name, and there an end, and no farther matter or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit for the future.</p>
                        <p>Know then, and I pray mark it ſeriouſly, that you may know it, and I may not beat onely the air and your ear, but alſo the heart and the fire in you, (if you be of <hi>Gods Elect</hi>) that your <hi>Infant-baptiſm</hi> was of vertue, and effectual to the taking away of the guilt of ſin, and to the furtherance of your ſalvation, not <hi>onely</hi> in that <hi>hour</hi> it was taken and received by you from me in your Infancy, but it is, and may be, and will be (if you be not the hinderance thereunto, and to your ſelf) of force, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to the ſame good ends for the time future, and to come; yea, throughout <hi>your whole life time,</hi> as alſo in all other ſuch, as are elect children of God, truly and inwardly baptized or regenerate.</p>
                        <p>The which truth, as being of grat moment in and againſt this <hi>new buſineſs</hi> of yours, I will prove both by Scripture and Reaſon, and both briefly; (for I confeſs I am too tedious and long, but it is that I might do you the more good, and Baptiſm the more right) St. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. ſaith, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; is baptized,</hi> in preſent for the act and ſome preſent benefit; but it extendeth its vertue farther to time future, for <hi>he ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>They are buried with Chriſt in baptiſm, and are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168478:166"/>riſen with him.</hi> They are ſo, now a long time after, finding the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and effects thereof, who were long before baptized as to the act, and ſome initial fruits thereof, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Even Baptiſm doth now alſo ſave us;</hi> now in our latter dayes it ſaveth us, though in former times received by us.</p>
                        <p>So in reaſon it muſt be ſo, for Baptiſm is, and was to you, the Sacrament of your inſition and ingrafting into Chriſt, ſealing up your ſetting into Chriſt, the which you needed but once, and never after to be done again; for the force thereof goeth on and continueth for all times, as a grafted Crab-ſtock holdeth on and continueth, bearing alſo fruit, if it be not broken off; Once engrafting, though often nouriſhing, once regenerating, and alwayes increaſing, is the Grace of Chriſt, and the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: and if it were not ſo, that the force of our once being baptized did continue and reach to the waſhing off all the ſins of our whole time, why then, you would have upon every ſin, which is a ſeparation of you from God, a new ingrafting, and ſo a new ſeal of it, Baptiſm, or ſomewhat elſe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, becauſe as long as the Covenant it ſelf is of force and effectual, ſo long is Baptiſm of force and effectual; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundation and ſubſtance of this, (as every promiſe or covenant is of the ſeal) in which God promiſeth and covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to, and with the party, baptized inwardly, to be their God, and the God of their ſeed. But this covenant of the Grace of God to you, and all his Elect children, is eternal, and ſo effectual at all times; ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.10. <hi>The mountains ſhall remove, and the hills ſhall fall down, but my mercy ſhall not depart away from thee, neither ſhall the covenant of my peace fall away, ſaith the Lord, who hath compaſſion on thee.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jeremy</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will make</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>an everlaſtingcovenant with them, that I will never turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> So hence may fairly be inferred and concluded, That he Covenant of Gods grace with you being eternal, the Seal of this Covenant, which is Baptiſm, is alſo eternal for the efficacy thereof; not limited to any time, much leſs the time it is in taking: and therefore being imprinted upon you in your Infancy, according to Gods Covenant with you in your Infancy, <hi>(the God of thy ſeed)</hi> it is of force and vertue to you, throughout all your life time, yea, to all eternity.</p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:168478:166"/>
                        <p>Now then, Sir, did you not very evil to obſcure the Grace of God appearing to you, and to plunge your ſelf into ſuch an evil way, and ſhew ſuch ignorance of the word, as to <hi>renounce</hi> and lay aſide an <hi>effectual and powerful</hi> Chriſtian Baptiſm, ready and preſent at all times, in the fruits and effects thereof, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport you upon your faith and repentance, and all this for <hi>impotent, element,</hi> and <hi>beggarly rudiment,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.22. (for I may add your Affirmative of <hi>Dip again,</hi> to their Negatives, <hi>Touch not, taſte not, which all are to periſh with uſing</hi>) ordinances after the commandments of men, <hi>having indeed a ſhew of wiſdom in Will-worſhip and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and neglecting of the body, not in any honour to the ſatisfying of the fleſh,</hi> or <hi>ſanctifying</hi> either fleſh or ſpirit, or which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeal of any Covenant by Gods inſtitution, neither leaves any benefit behinde it in the preſent act, nor carrieth any good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it to the future life; as you will ſee when the ſcales fall off from your eyes which now hang upon them.</p>
                        <p>In this you did but run along with the Papiſts, if you did not out-run them: they teach that Baptiſm of Infants taketh away all ſin that goeth before it, (as Original ſin) but for ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after (as actual ones) they muſt be taken away by their devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament of Penance, or Repentance. And your maſters have taught and told you, that they muſt be taken away, and that after Repentance hath taken them away, by their forged Sacrament of Re-dipping; and ſo both of you do, though in ſeveral wayes, deſtroy the true nature and uſe of Baptiſm, which is the Laver for all ſins, <hi>paſt, preſent,</hi> and <hi>to come,</hi> to be waſhed in, and away, as to the guilt and filth of them.</p>
                        <p>True, that Repentance is alſo another good way to take off ſins committed, and to procure the remiſſion of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods Promiſe and Covenant; but it muſt not thruſt out Baptiſm, to bring in it ſelf to be a Sacrament of Pennance, as the Papiſts would have it; nor lay aſide your Infant-baptiſm, to carry you out to a Man-dippiſm, as the Anabaptiſts have ſerved you: For that your Infant-baptiſm being the Seal of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant, is ever effectual and of force; and upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of your actual ſins, at any time whatſoever, will, &amp; doth comfortably aſſure and ſeal unto both, the pardon and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them; ſo that there will need no new Sacrament to be ſet
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:168478:167"/>up by them, of penance, nor any ſecond dipping to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by you, as a Sacrament of profeſſion, as I may call it.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I have been the bolder with you, and the larger in my diſcourſe, for that I fear you have not been ſufficiently taught (and yet even in this point of Baptiſm, I have alſo formerly catechized you, with the other young men of my Pariſh, when for three years together I made it my Afternoons buſineſs on the Lords day) by your Parents, or thoſe who did as Sponſors or Sureties, undertake for you, the meaning and Doctrine of your Infant-baptiſm; when you came to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, unfolding unto you Gods precious Promiſes therein, made to you, and your ſtrict Engagements ſtipultated to God by them: and if ſo it be, then alſo you ought ſo much the more, now you know their default, and underſtand your ſelf, to be more earneſt, ſerious, and laborious in learning it out, and teaching your ſelf the ſame. <hi>For thou which teacheſt another,</hi> (as my ſelf you aſſayed to do in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>teaches thou not thy ſelf?

I add but a few words, and I alſo ſhall have done teaching you, and I hope at leaſtwiſe learning of you, if not learning you.</p>
                        <p>I will not ſay to you, <hi>He that is ignorant, let him be ignorant ſtill;</hi> but if you have been ignorant, learn now to know; and if you have been <hi>ſlighting</hi> of your Infant-baptiſm, have hereafter a <hi>high esteem</hi> of it; not as of <hi>humane Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Formality</hi> of the Church, but an <hi>honorable Ordinance,</hi> and <hi>appointment</hi> of God, who never impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people any Service or Order in <hi>vain,</hi> wherein the covenanted Blood of Chriſt was, and is ſtill <hi>myſterially</hi> and <hi>miniſterially</hi> ſealed up unto you, for the purging away of that pollution you brought with you into the world; by which Grace of Gods Covenant, and the Seal thereof in your Baptiſm, you have ſtood <hi>hitherto</hi> in your relation to God, as a <hi>member</hi> of Chriſt, under Gods protection and favor; and in <hi>diſcrimination</hi> from the Heathen world, as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> under the fruition and uſe of all its ſaving and ſanctifying Ordinances: And is this a matter to be vilified, difeſteemed, rejected, and renounced.</p>

For you was as a ſheep going aſtray, but if you ſhall return unto this Shepherd and Biſhop of your ſoul, <hi>When the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, you ſhall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away,</hi> whereby you will be glorified in heaven; and in the mean time he will put a <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs</hi> upon your head that falleth not off, whereby you ſhall be both juſtified and ſanctified alſo. Nay, your ſelf will thus become a <hi>Crown of rejoycing</hi> to us all, my ſelf eſpecially; <hi>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoycing? Are not even you in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus at his coming? Yea, you are our glory and joy,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.19. Therefore, <hi>my brother, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown,</hi> Phil. 4.1. return unto the Lord, (the Lords Church and Flock, the Lords Miniſtery and Paſturage, the Lords Covenant with Parents and their Children, the Lords Baptiſm and Sheep-mark) <hi>and ſo ſtand faſt in the Lord my dearly beloved. Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepherd of the ſheep, through the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work</hi> (of righteouſneſs and word of truth) <hi>working in you that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</hi> Heb. 13.20, 21.</p>
                        <p>If yet, notwithſtanding all this friendly invitation and fair warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you will not hear and hearken to come in, but will go ſtill aſtray, <hi>My ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your pride; and mine eyes ſhall run down with tears, becauſe the Lords flock</hi> (and your ſelf for one amongſt them) <hi>is carried away captive,</hi> Jer. 13.17.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wherefore I take you to record this day</hi> (in which you have read over
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:168478:171"/>what I have written to you) <hi>that I am pure from, the blood of you all;</hi> (you and all, for what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all) <hi>for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God,</hi> Acts 20.26, 27. in theſe particulars that he hath out of his Word revealed unto me.</p>
                        <p>And ſo I have <hi>delivered my ſoul,</hi> as to you and them, by foretelling and forewarning you of the truth, as a <hi>Watchman</hi> ſet over you, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.9. if you will not deliver your ſoul, by obeying the truth, and ſubmit thereunto, when it is held out to you, <hi>by him who hath the rule,</hi> or guide and overſight of you, <hi>and watcheth for your ſoul, and muſt give account,</hi> and would do it <hi>with joy and not with grief (for that is unprofitable for you,</hi> Heb. 13.17.) Then, <hi>you will die in your iniquity</hi> and obſtinacy, <hi>your blood will be required at your own hands,</hi> and will lie upon your own head; who can help it, unleſs <hi>God forbid it,</hi> the which alſo <hi>God forbid, I pray God.</hi> Yea, once more alſo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I call heaven and earth to record this day againſt you,</hi> Deut. 30.19. (or for you) <hi>that I have ſet before you life and death, Bleſſing and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; therefore chuſe life, that both thou and thy ſeed may live, and that thou mayeſt love the Lord thy God,</hi> and that his <hi>Covenant</hi> that he made <hi>(to be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed)</hi> and <hi>that thou mayeſt obey his voyce,</hi> and that command for the baptizing of the Parent and his Seed: <hi>That thou mayeſt cleave unto him,</hi> and not forſake your God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with you, <hi>ſealed in your Infancy,</hi> by <hi>renouncing your Baptiſm then,</hi> and now running after <hi>other unprofitable Dippings: for he is thy life, and the length of thy dayes, that thou mayeſt dwell</hi> here on earth a while, and alſo be in Heaven for ever.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>now to him that is of power to eſtabliſh you, according to the Goſpel and preaching of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Revelation of the myſtery, which was kept ſecret ſince the world began, but now is made manifeſt, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the Commandement of the Everlaſting God, made known to all Nations, for the obedience of Faith; To God onely wiſe, be glory through Jeſus Chriſt, for ever, Amen.</hi> Rom. 16 25, 26, 27.</p>
                        <p>To which onely wiſe God and his Providence, committing my ſelf, and what I have written here; as likewiſe to the ſame onely good God, and his bleſſing commending you, and what you ſhall read here, even <hi>to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up,</hi> who are fallen from that of Baptiſm, and to eſtabliſh all that ſtand therein, I take my leave, and give you farewel, reſting your affectionate, and <hi>inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Friend,</hi>
